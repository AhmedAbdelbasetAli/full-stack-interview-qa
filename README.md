## 📚 How to Use This Repo

### 🧭 Navigate and Study by Topic
- Spend **30–60 minutes daily** focusing on one section (e.g., JavaScript, Spring Boot, DSA).
- Try to **answer questions out loud or on paper** before checking the provided answers.
- Use this method to simulate real interview pressure and improve recall.

### 💻 Practice Coding
- Solve **DSA problems manually** (on paper or whiteboard) to build problem-solving stamina.
- Alternatively, use your **IDE** for hands-on practice — but avoid relying on autocomplete.
- Simulate **real interview conditions**: no Google, no hints, 20–30 minutes per problem.

### 🤝 Contribute and Improve
- Found a **typo**, **inaccurate answer**, or have a **better explanation**?  
  → Your contribution matters!
- Feel free to **edit or add questions** to keep the content up-to-date and helpful.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to submit improvements.

### 📈 Track Your Progress
- Mark completed topics with a ✅ to visualize your progress.
- Revisit **weak areas weekly** to reinforce understanding.
- Use the [30-Day Study Plan](study-plan/30-day-plan.md) (coming soon) to stay on track.
