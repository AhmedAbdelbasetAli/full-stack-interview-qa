# 🧱 SOLID Principles Deep Dive  
**Object-Oriented Design for Clean, Maintainable Code**

This document provides a **comprehensive, in-depth explanation** of the **SOLID principles** — the **foundation of clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented design**.

Each section includes:
- ✅ Clear definition
- ✅ In-depth explanation
- ✅ Java examples
- ✅ Common anti-patterns
- ✅ Interview-ready answers

---

## 1. What are the SOLID principles? Explain each briefly.

> **SOLID** is an acronym for **five object-oriented design principles** introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** to make software designs **more understandable, flexible, and maintainable**.

| Acronym | Principle |
|-------|----------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) |
| **O** | Open/Closed Principle (OCP) |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) |
| **I** | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) |

Let’s break down each one.

---

### 🔹 1.1 S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> **"A class should have only one reason to change."**

A class should be responsible for **one, and only one, job**.

---

#### 🟦 Bad Example: God Class
```java
class User {
    void saveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }
    void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
    void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
    void validate() { /* ... */ }
}
```

❌ Too many responsibilities → hard to maintain.

---

#### ✅ Good: Separate Responsibilities
```java
class UserService {
    public void createUser(User user) { /* validate + save */ }
}

class EmailService {
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(User user) { /* ... */ }
}

class ReportService {
    public void generateUserReport() { /* ... */ }
}
```

✅ Each class has **one job**.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"SRP states that a class should have only one responsibility. This makes it easier to understand, test, and modify. I apply it by ensuring each class has a single purpose — like UserService for business logic, EmailService for notifications."_  

---

### 🔹 1.2 O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> **"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**

You should be able to **add new behavior** without changing existing code.

---

#### 🟦 Bad: Modifying Code
```java
class AreaCalculator {
    double calculateArea(Object shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Circle) {
            Circle c = (Circle) shape;
            return Math.PI * c.radius * c.radius;
        } else if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
            Rectangle r = (Rectangle) shape;
            return r.width * r.height;
        }
        // ❌ Add new shape? Must modify this method
    }
}
```

❌ Violates OCP — every new shape requires code change.

---

#### ✅ Good: Use Polymorphism
```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public double area() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public double area() { return width * height; }
}

class AreaCalculator {
    double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return shape.area(); // ✅ No change needed for new shapes
    }
}
```

✅ Now you can add `Triangle` without touching `AreaCalculator`.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"OCP means classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. I achieve this using polymorphism — define a `Shape` interface, and let each shape implement `area()`. Adding a new shape doesn’t require changing the calculator. This makes the system more stable and extensible."_  

---

### 🔹 1.3 L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> **"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application."**

Subtypes must **behave like their base type**.

---

#### 🟦 Bad: Violating LSP
```java
class Rectangle {
    protected int width, height;

    public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; }
    public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; }

    public int area() { return width * height; }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = width; // ❌ Changes height!
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = height; // ❌ Changes width!
    }
}
```

❌ Now:
```java
Rectangle r = new Square();
r.setWidth(5);
r.setHeight(4); // But width becomes 4!
System.out.println(r.area()); // 16, not 20 → unexpected!
```

---

#### ✅ Good: Don’t Force Inheritance
```java
// Better: Use composition or avoid inheritance
interface Shape {
    int area();
}
```

✅ Or make `Rectangle` and `Square` independent.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"LSP says a child class should behave like its parent. If I expect a Rectangle, a Square shouldn’t break behavior by changing both dimensions. I avoid this by preferring composition over inheritance, or using interfaces. This ensures polymorphism works safely."_  

---

### 🔹 1.4 I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> **"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."**

Create **small, focused interfaces** instead of large, general ones.

---

#### 🟦 Bad: Fat Interface
```java
interface Machine {
    void print();
    void scan();
    void fax();
}

class OldPrinter implements Machine {
    public void print() { System.out.println("Printing"); }
    public void scan() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
    public void fax() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
}
```

❌ `OldPrinter` is forced to implement methods it doesn’t support.

---

#### ✅ Good: Segregated Interfaces
```java
interface Printer {
    void print();
}

interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}

interface FaxMachine {
    void fax();
}

class OldPrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() { System.out.println("Printing"); }
}

class MultiFunctionDevice implements Printer, Scanner, FaxMachine {
    public void print() { /* ... */ }
    public void scan() { /* ... */ }
    public void fax() { /* ... */ }
}
```

✅ Each class implements only what it needs.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"ISP says don’t force classes to implement unused methods. I create fine-grained interfaces like `Printer`, `Scanner`, instead of a fat `Machine` interface. This makes code cleaner and prevents `UnsupportedOperationException` errors. Clients only depend on what they use."_  

---

### 🔹 1.5 D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**

> **"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."**

---

#### 🟦 Bad: High-Level Depends on Low-Level
```java
class EmailService {
    public void send(String to, String msg) { /* ... */ }
}

class NotificationService {
    private EmailService email = new EmailService(); // ❌ Direct dependency
    public void notify(String user) {
        email.send(user, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

❌ `NotificationService` is tightly coupled to `EmailService`.

---

#### ✅ Good: Depend on Abstraction
```java
interface MessageService {
    void send(String to, String msg);
}

class EmailService implements MessageService {
    public void send(String to, String msg) { /* ... */ }
}

class SMSService implements MessageService {
    public void send(String to, String msg) { /* ... */ }
}

class NotificationService {
    private MessageService service; // ✅ Depends on abstraction

    public NotificationService(MessageService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void notify(String user) {
        service.send(user, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

✅ Now `NotificationService` works with **any** `MessageService`.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"DIP says high-level code should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. I use interfaces so that `NotificationService` depends on `MessageService`, not `EmailService`. This allows easy swapping and testing. Spring’s `@Autowired` and DI containers are built on this principle."_  

---

## 2. What is Dependency Injection? How does it improve code quality?

> **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a **design pattern** where **dependencies are provided to a class** from outside, rather than created inside.

It’s a **key implementation of DIP**.

---

### 🔹 2.1 Example: Constructor Injection (Recommended)
```java
@Service
class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repo;

    public UserService(UserRepository repo) { // Injected
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
```

✅ Spring or any DI framework injects `UserRepository`.

---

### 🔹 2.2 How DI Improves Code Quality

| Benefit | How |
|--------|-----|
| ✅ **Loose Coupling** | Classes depend on abstractions |
| ✅ **Testability** | Inject mocks in unit tests |
| ✅ **Reusability** | Same class works with different implementations |
| ✅ **Maintainability** | Change behavior without changing code |
| ✅ **Centralized Configuration** | All wiring in one place |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer
> _"Dependency Injection provides dependencies from outside, usually via constructor. It improves code quality by reducing coupling, making classes testable with mocks, and allowing easy swapping of implementations. I use it with Spring’s `@Autowired` to build modular, maintainable systems."_  

---

## 3. What is the Open/Closed Principle?

> Already covered in **Section 1.2** above.

✅ **Summary**:  
> Classes should be **open for extension** (add new features) but **closed for modification** (don’t change existing code). Achieved via **abstraction and polymorphism**.

---

## 4. What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

> Already covered in **Section 1.3** above.

✅ **Summary**:  
> Subtypes must **behave like their base type**. If a program expects a `Parent`, passing a `Child` should not break behavior.

---

## 5. What is the Interface Segregation Principle?

> Already covered in **Section 1.4** above.

✅ **Summary**:  
> Create **small, client-specific interfaces** instead of large, general ones. Avoid forcing classes to implement unused methods.

Part 2 
---

## 1. What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)?

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**  
> **"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."**

This is the **"D" in SOLID** — and the foundation of **loose coupling**.

---

### 🔹 1.1 Why It Matters

Without DIP:
```java
class NotificationService {
    private EmailService email = new EmailService(); // ❌ High-level depends on low-level
}
```

✅ Problems:
- Tightly coupled
- Hard to test (can't mock `EmailService`)
- Hard to extend (no SMS, push, etc.)

---

### 🔹 1.2 With DIP: Depend on Abstractions

```java
// Abstraction
interface MessageService {
    void send(String to, String msg);
}

// Low-level details
class EmailService implements MessageService {
    public void send(String to, String msg) {
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + to);
    }
}

class SMSService implements MessageService {
    public void send(String to, String msg) {
        System.out.println("SMS sent to " + to);
    }
}

// High-level module
class NotificationService {
    private MessageService service; // ✅ Depends on abstraction

    public NotificationService(MessageService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void notify(String user) {
        service.send(user, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

✅ Now:
- `NotificationService` doesn’t care which service is used
- Easy to **swap** or **extend** (add `PushService`)
- Easy to **test** (inject mock)

---

### 🔹 1.3 How DIP Enables Dependency Injection (DI)

```java
// Spring example
@Service
class NotificationService {
    @Autowired
    private MessageService service; // DI container injects implementation
}
```

✅ DI is the **implementation mechanism** for DIP.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. I apply it by defining interfaces like `MessageService`, so `NotificationService` doesn’t depend on `EmailService`. This makes the system flexible, testable, and extensible. Spring’s DI is a practical implementation of DIP."_  

---

## 2. What is the Factory Pattern? When would you use it?

> The **Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that **encapsulates object creation logic** — so the client doesn’t have to know how to create objects.

It **decouples** object creation from usage.

---

### 🔹 2.1 Problem: Direct Object Creation

```java
class PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(String type) {
        PaymentGateway gateway;
        if (type.equals("paypal")) {
            gateway = new PayPalGateway();
        } else if (type.equals("stripe")) {
            gateway = new StripeGateway();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown type");
        }
        gateway.charge(100);
    }
}
```

❌ Problems:
- Logic scattered
- Hard to extend (add new gateway)
- Violates Open/Closed Principle

---

### 🔹 2.2 Solution: Factory Pattern

```java
interface PaymentGateway {
    void charge(double amount);
}

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway { /* ... */ }
class StripeGateway implements PaymentGateway { /* ... */ }

// Factory
class PaymentGatewayFactory {
    public PaymentGateway create(String type) {
        return switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "paypal" -> new PayPalGateway();
            case "stripe" -> new StripeGateway();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported gateway: " + type);
        };
    }
}

// Client
class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGatewayFactory factory = new PaymentGatewayFactory();

    public void process(String type) {
        PaymentGateway gateway = factory.create(type);
        gateway.charge(100);
    }
}
```

✅ Now:
- Creation logic is **centralized**
- Easy to **extend** (add new gateway in factory)
- Client doesn’t know implementation details

---

### 🔹 2.3 When to Use Factory Pattern

| Use Case | Example |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Object creation is complex | Configuring API clients |
| ✅ Multiple implementations | Payment, Logging, Messaging |
| ✅ Want to hide construction logic | Database connections |
| ✅ Follow Open/Closed Principle | Add new types without changing client |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The Factory Pattern encapsulates object creation. I use it when I have multiple implementations of an interface — like `PayPalGateway` and `StripeGateway`. The factory decides which to create based on input. This keeps the client code clean and makes it easy to add new types without changing existing code. It’s a great way to follow the Open/Closed Principle."_  

---

## 3. What is the Strategy Pattern?

> The **Strategy Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that **defines a family of algorithms**, encapsulates each one, and makes them **interchangeable**.

It lets the algorithm **vary independently** from the clients that use it.

---

### 🔹 3.1 Problem: Hardcoded Logic

```java
class ShoppingCart {
    double total;
    String discountType;

    public double calculateTotal() {
        if ("seasonal".equals(discountType)) {
            return total * 0.9;
        } else if ("member".equals(discountType)) {
            return total * 0.8;
        } else if ("none".equals(discountType)) {
            return total;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

❌ Problems:
- Logic in client
- Hard to add new discounts
- Violates Single Responsibility and Open/Closed

---

### 🔹 3.2 Solution: Strategy Pattern

```java
// Strategy interface
interface DiscountStrategy {
    double apply(double total);
}

// Concrete strategies
class SeasonalDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double apply(double total) {
        return total * 0.9;
    }
}

class MemberDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double apply(double total) {
        return total * 0.8;
    }
}

class NoDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double apply(double total) {
        return total;
    }
}

// Context
class ShoppingCart {
    private double total;
    private DiscountStrategy strategy;

    public ShoppingCart(DiscountStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(DiscountStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public double calculateTotal() {
        return strategy.apply(total);
    }
}
```

✅ Now:
- Algorithms are **encapsulated**
- Easy to **add new strategies** (e.g., `HolidayDiscount`)
- Easy to **switch at runtime**

---

### 🔹 3.3 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Payment methods | PayPal, Stripe, Apple Pay |
| ✅ Sorting algorithms | QuickSort, MergeSort |
| ✅ Compression | ZIP, GZIP, RAR |
| ✅ Routing algorithms | GPS navigation (fastest, shortest) |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The Strategy Pattern defines a family of interchangeable algorithms. I use it for things like discounts, payment methods, or sorting. Each algorithm implements a common interface, and the context (e.g., ShoppingCart) uses it without knowing the details. This makes the system flexible — I can add new strategies without changing the client. It’s perfect for runtime switching and follows Open/Closed and Single Responsibility principles."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine patterns**:
> _"I use the Strategy Pattern for interchangeable algorithms, the Factory Pattern to create them, and Dependency Injection to inject them — all based on the Dependency Inversion Principle."_  

That shows **deep, integrated understanding** — exactly what senior roles want.
