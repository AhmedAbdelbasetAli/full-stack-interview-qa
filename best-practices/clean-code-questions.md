# üßº Clean Code Interview Questions

A list of common questions about writing clean, readable, and maintainable code ‚Äî essential for technical interviews, code reviews, and professional software development.

## üìù Code Readability & Structure

1. What does "clean code" mean to you?

2. What are the characteristics of clean, maintainable code?

3. Why is naming important in programming? What makes a good variable, function, or class name?

5. How do you decide when to extract a method or class?

6. What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?

7. Why should functions do only one thing?

8. How do you write self-documenting code?

9. When should you use comments? Are comments always a good idea?

10. What are code smells? Give examples (e.g., long methods, duplicated code).

## üîß Functions & Methods

11. What makes a good function signature?

12. How many parameters should a function ideally have?

13. What are the problems with flag arguments (boolean parameters)?

14. What is command-query separation?

15. Should functions have side effects? When are they acceptable?

---

## üìö Error Handling & Robustness

16. How do you handle errors and exceptions cleanly?

17. What is the problem with empty catch blocks?

18. Should you return `null` or throw an exception?

19. What is the Null Object Pattern?

20. How do you avoid deep nesting of `if` statements and callbacks ("callback hell")?

---

## üîÅ Code Organization & Design

21. What is the difference between coupling and cohesion?

22. Why is tight coupling problematic?

23. What are magic numbers and magic strings? How do you avoid them?

24. How do you organize imports and dependencies in a clean way?

25. What is the purpose of layers in an application (e.g., controller, service, repository)?

---

## üß© Design Principles & Patterns

26. What are the SOLID principles? Explain each briefly.

27. What is Dependency Injection? How does it improve code quality?

28. What is the Open/Closed Principle?

29. What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

30. What is the Interface Segregation Principle?

31. What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

32. What is the Factory Pattern? When would you use it?

33. What is the Strategy Pattern?

---

## üß™ Testing & Maintainability

34. How does clean code relate to testability?

35. What makes code hard to test?

36. What is the AAA pattern in unit testing (Arrange, Act, Assert)?

37. How do you write clean unit tests?

38. What is test coverage? Is 100% coverage always necessary?

39. What is refactoring? When should you refactor code?

40. How do you refactor legacy code safely?

---

## üõ† Tools & Practices

41. What are linters (e.g., ESLint, Checkstyle)? How do they help?

42. What are formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black)? Why use them?

43. What is code review? What should you look for in a clean code review?

44. How do you handle duplicated code?

45. What is technical debt? How do you manage it?

46. What is boy scout rule in programming ("Leave the code cleaner than you found it")?

47. How do you balance clean code with delivery deadlines?

---

## üß† Real-World Scenarios

48. How would you improve a long, messy function with many conditionals?

49. How do you handle configuration and environment-specific values cleanly?

50. What are some habits of developers who write clean code?

## üìå Tip:
In interviews, **show** clean code by writing small, well-named functions, avoiding duplication, and explaining your choices. Interviewers don‚Äôt just want working code ‚Äî they want **readable, scalable, and maintainable** code.
