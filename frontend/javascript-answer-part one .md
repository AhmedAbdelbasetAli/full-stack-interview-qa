## 1. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

### ✅ Overview

| Keyword | Scope | Hoisting | Reassignment | Re-declaration |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `var` | Function-scoped | Hoisted (undefined) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (in same scope) |
| `let` | Block-scoped (`{}`) | Hoisted (TDZ) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| `const` | Block-scoped (`{}`) | Hoisted (TDZ) | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> 🔹 **TDZ** = Temporal Dead Zone — you can't access the variable before declaration

---

### 🔹 1.1 `var` – Function-Scoped & Hoisted

#### 🟦 How It Works
- Declared with **function scope** (not block scope)
- **Hoisted** to the top of the function/global scope
- Initialized as `undefined` during hoisting

```js
console.log(x); // undefined (not ReferenceError)
var x = 10;

// Equivalent to:
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 10;
```

#### 🟦 Function vs Block Scope
```js
if (true) {
  var a = 1;
}
console.log(a); // 1 → accessible outside block!
```

```js
function test() {
  var b = 2;
}
test();
console.log(b); // ReferenceError → function-scoped
```

> ❌ This is why `var` leads to bugs — variables leak out of blocks.

---

### 🔹 1.2 `let` – Block-Scoped & TDZ

#### 🟦 How It Works
- **Block-scoped**: only accessible within `{}` (if, for, function)
- **Hoisted but in Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**
- Cannot be accessed before declaration

```js
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 20;
```

#### 🟦 Block Scope Example
```js
if (true) {
  let c = 3;
}
console.log(c); // ReferenceError → c not accessible
```

#### 🟦 No Re-declaration
```js
let d = 1;
let d = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
```

---

### 🔹 1.3 `const` – Block-Scoped & Immutable Binding

#### 🟦 How It Works
- Same scoping rules as `let`
- **Cannot be reassigned**
- Must be initialized at declaration

```js
const e = 42;
e = 50; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

#### 🟦 Important: `const` doesn't make objects immutable
```js
const user = { name: "Alice" };
user.name = "Bob"; // ✅ OK — object is mutable
user.age = 30;     // ✅ OK

// But reassignment fails:
user = {}; // ❌ TypeError
```

✅ To make object truly immutable:
```js
const frozenUser = Object.freeze({ name: "Alice" });
frozenUser.name = "Bob"; // ❌ Fails silently in non-strict mode
```

---

### 💡 Best Practices

| Rule | Why |
|-----|-----|
| ✅ Prefer `const` over `let` | Prevents accidental reassignment |
| ✅ Use `let` only when reassignment needed | Clear intent |
| ❌ Avoid `var` in modern JS | Scoping issues, hoisting bugs |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The key differences are scope and reassignment behavior. `var` is function-scoped and hoisted to `undefined`, which can cause bugs. `let` and `const` are block-scoped and live in the Temporal Dead Zone before declaration. `let` allows reassignment, while `const` creates an immutable binding — though the object it points to can still be mutated. I always prefer `const` unless I need to reassign, then use `let`, and avoid `var` entirely."_  

---

## 2. What is a Closure in JavaScript? Provide an Example.

### ✅ Definition

> A **closure** is a function that **remembers its outer (enclosing) scope** even after the outer function has finished executing.

It’s created every time a function is defined — because functions in JavaScript **capture their lexical environment**.

---

### 🔹 2.1 How Closures Work (Memory Model)

When a function is created:
- It gets a hidden property `[[Environment]]` pointing to the **lexical environment** where it was defined
- This allows it to access variables from outer scopes

```js
function outer() {
  let x = 10;
  
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // ✅ Can access x due to closure
  }
  
  return inner;
}

const innerFunc = outer(); // outer() finishes
innerFunc(); // Still logs 10 → closure!
```

#### 🧠 Memory Diagram:
```
Global Lexical Environment:
  innerFunc → Function(inner) with [[Environment]] → outer's environment

outer's Lexical Environment (still alive due to closure):
  x: 10
```

✅ The **outer environment is preserved in memory** as long as the inner function exists.

---

### 🔹 2.2 Practical Examples

#### 🟦 Example 1: Counter with Private State
```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  
  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
// count is private — not accessible from outside
```

#### 🟦 Example 2: Event Handlers with Data
```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
// Logs: 4, 4, 4 → because var is not block-scoped
```

✅ Fix with closure:
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
// Logs: 1, 2, 3 → each i is in its own closure
```

#### 🟦 Example 3: Module Pattern
```js
const BankAccount = (initialBalance) => {
  let balance = initialBalance;
  
  return {
    deposit: (amount) => { balance += amount; },
    withdraw: (amount) => { balance -= amount; },
    getBalance: () => balance
  };
};

const account = BankAccount(100);
account.deposit(50);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 150
// balance is private
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Accidental closures in loops (with `var`) | Use `let` or IIFE |
| Memory leaks (large closures kept alive) | Null out references when done |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its outer scope, even after that scope has finished. It’s created when a nested function references outer variables. Closures enable data privacy, function factories, and event handlers with captured data. For example, I use closures to create private state in modules or to fix loop variable issues in async callbacks. The inner function keeps a reference to the outer lexical environment, so those variables stay alive in memory."_  

---

## 3. How Does the Event Loop Work in JavaScript?

### ✅ Overview

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, but handles async operations via the **Event Loop**.

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│       Call Stack      │ ← Runs sync code
└───────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│     Callback Queue    │ ← Holds async callbacks (setTimeout, DOM, I/O)
└───────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│     Event Loop        │ ← Moves callbacks to stack when stack is empty
└───────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌───────────────────────┐
│   Web APIs (Browser)  │ ← Handles async tasks (setTimeout, fetch, DOM)
└───────────────────────┘
```

---

### 🔹 3.1 Step-by-Step Execution

```js
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => console.log("2"), 0);

console.log("3");

// Output: 1, 3, 2
```

#### 🟦 What Happens?
1. `console.log("1")` → pushed to stack → executed
2. `setTimeout(...)` → pushed to stack
   - Web API takes it, starts timer
   - Callback queued when timer ends
   - `setTimeout` pops off stack
3. `console.log("3")` → runs
4. Stack is empty → Event Loop checks queue
5. Callback `console.log("2")` → pushed to stack → executed

> 🔁 The Event Loop continuously checks: **Is the stack empty? If yes, move a callback from the queue.**

---

### 🔹 3.2 Microtasks vs Macrotasks

| Task Type | Examples | Queue Priority |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Macrotasks** | `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, I/O, rendering | Lower |
| **Microtasks** | `Promise.then`, `queueMicrotask`, `MutationObserver` | Higher |

> ✅ **Microtasks run before the next macrotask**

#### Example:
```js
console.log("1");

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("2"));

setTimeout(() => console.log("3"), 0);

console.log("4");

// Output: 1, 4, 2, 3
```

✅ Why?
- After sync code, microtask queue is processed first (`Promise.then`)
- Then macrotask queue (`setTimeout`)

---

### 🔹 3.3 Event Loop Rules

1. Only one statement executes at a time
2. Async callbacks go to Web APIs → then to queues
3. Event Loop moves callbacks to stack **only when stack is empty**
4. Microtasks are processed **entirely** before next macrotask

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The Event Loop is what makes JavaScript non-blocking. It continuously checks the call stack and task queues. When the stack is empty, it moves a callback from the queue to the stack. Microtasks (like Promises) have higher priority than macrotasks (like setTimeout). This ensures that Promise callbacks run before the next render or timer, which is crucial for responsiveness. The Event Loop, combined with Web APIs, allows JavaScript to handle async operations without multi-threading."_

## 4. What is the Difference Between `==` and `===`?

| Operator | Name | Compares | Type Coercion? |
|--------|------|---------|----------------|
| `==` | Loose Equality | Value | ✅ Yes |
| `===` | Strict Equality | Value + Type | ❌ No |

---

### 🔹 4.1 How `==` Works (With Coercion)

`==` performs **type coercion** before comparison.

#### 🟦 Examples
```js
5 == "5"     // true → string "5" → number 5
true == 1    // true → boolean true → number 1
false == 0   // true → boolean false → number 0
null == undefined // true → special rule
[] == ""     // true → [] → "" → 0, "" → 0
```

#### 🟦 Coercion Rules
- Objects → `toString()` or `valueOf()`
- Strings → numbers
- Booleans → 1/0
- `null` and `undefined` → equal to each other

> ❌ This leads to unpredictable results.

---

### 🔹 4.2 How `===` Works (No Coercion)

`===` compares **value and type** — no conversion.

```js
5 === "5"     // false → different types
true === 1    // false
null === undefined // false
[] === ""     // false
```

✅ Predictable and safe.

---

### 🔹 4.3 When `==` Can Be Dangerous

```js
if (input == false) {
  // This runs for: false, 0, "", null, undefined, []
}
```

✅ Better:
```js
if (input === false) {
  // Only runs if input is exactly false
}
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The difference is that `==` performs type coercion before comparison, while `===` checks both value and type without coercion. For example, `5 == '5'` is true because the string is converted to a number, but `5 === '5'` is false. I always use `===` to avoid unexpected behavior from coercion. The only exception is checking for null/undefined with `== null`, which safely checks for both."_  

---

## 5. What Does the `this` Keyword Refer to in Different Contexts?

> `this` is **not** fixed — it’s **determined at call time**, not definition time.

---

### 🔹 5.1 Global Context

```js
console.log(this); // In browser: window
                   // In Node.js: global object
```

---

### 🔹 5.2 Function Context

#### 🟦 Default (Non-Strict)
```js
function f() {
  console.log(this); // window (browser)
}
f(); // Called as function → global object
```

#### 🟦 Strict Mode
```js
function f() {
  'use strict';
  console.log(this); // undefined
}
f();
```

---

### 🔹 5.3 Method Context

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name); // Alice
  }
};
user.greet(); // this → user
```

#### 🟦 Losing `this`
```js
const greet = user.greet;
greet(); // this → window → undefined (strict mode)
```

✅ Fix with `.bind()`, arrow function, or store `const self = this`

---

### 🔹 5.4 Constructor Context

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const p = new Person("Bob");
// this → new empty object linked to Person.prototype
```

---

### 🔹 5.5 Arrow Functions (No `this`)

Arrow functions **inherit `this` from enclosing scope**

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  delayedGreet: function() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this.name); // Alice → inherits from delayedGreet
    }, 100);
  }
};
```

✅ Without arrow:
```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log(this.name); // undefined → this → window
}, 100);
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The value of `this` depends on how a function is called. In global scope, it's the global object. In a method, it's the object before the dot. In a constructor, it's the new instance. In a regular function, it's the global object (or undefined in strict mode). Arrow functions don't have their own `this` — they inherit it from the enclosing scope, which makes them ideal for callbacks inside methods."_
