## 6. What is the Virtual DOM? How does it improve performance?

> The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a **lightweight JavaScript representation** of the real DOM.

It’s not the real DOM — it’s a **tree of JavaScript objects** that React uses to compute the minimal changes needed.

---

### 🔹 6.1 How the Virtual DOM Works

```
1. Render → Create Virtual DOM
2. State Change → New Virtual DOM
3. Diffing (Reconciliation) → Compare old vs new
4. Patching → Apply minimal changes to Real DOM
```

#### 🟦 Example
```jsx
// Initial render
const vdom1 = <div><h1>Hello</h1><p>World</p></div>;

// After state change
const vdom2 = <div><h1>Hi</h1><p>World</p></div>;
```

React **diffs** the trees:
- Same `<div>` and `<p>`
- Only `<h1>` text changed

✅ Only updates the text node in the real DOM.

---

### 🔹 6.2 Why It Improves Performance

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|---------|
| ❌ Direct DOM manipulation is slow | ✅ VDOM allows batched, minimal updates |
| ❌ Re-rendering entire UI on every change | ✅ Only changed parts are updated |
| ❌ Manual DOM diffing is error-prone | ✅ React handles reconciliation automatically |

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Updating the real DOM is expensive. VDOM lets React **calculate changes in memory** — fast.

---

### 🔹 6.3 Reconciliation & Diffing Rules

1. **Elements of different types** → Replace subtree
   ```jsx
   <div> → <span> // Entire subtree destroyed
   ```
2. **Same type** → Update only changed props
3. **Lists** → Use `key` to track identity
   ```jsx
   <Item key={item.id} /> // React knows which item moved
   ```

✅ Without `key`, React re-renders all list items — **slow**.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object tree that represents the UI. When state changes, React creates a new VDOM, diffs it with the previous one, and computes the minimal set of changes. It then applies those changes to the real DOM in a batch. This minimizes expensive DOM operations and keeps the UI fast. Without VDOM, we’d have to manually optimize every update — React does it automatically."_

## 7. What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?

| Hook | When It Fires | Use Case | Blocking? |
|------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `useEffect` | **Asynchronously** after paint | Most side effects (API calls, subscriptions) | ❌ No |
| `useLayoutEffect` | **Synchronously** after DOM mutations, before paint | DOM measurements, imperative styling | ✅ Yes |

---

### 🔹 7.1 `useEffect` – Async, Non-Blocking

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Fires after browser has painted
  console.log("useEffect");
}, []);
```

✅ Use for:
- Data fetching
- Event listeners
- Timers
- Logging

> 🔁 Does **not block** the browser — UI is responsive.

---

### 🔹 7.2 `useLayoutEffect` – Sync, Blocking

```jsx
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Fires after DOM updates, before paint
  const height = ref.current.offsetHeight;
  console.log("Height:", height);
}, []);
```

✅ Use for:
- Reading layout (offsetHeight, getBoundingClientRect)
- Synchronizing visual updates
- Preventing flicker

> ⚠️ **Blocks the browser** — can hurt performance if overused

---

### 🔹 7.3 When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Hook |
|--------|------|
| Fetch data from API | `useEffect` |
| Measure DOM element size | `useLayoutEffect` |
| Add event listener | `useEffect` |
| Update styles based on layout | `useLayoutEffect` |
| Avoid visual flicker | `useLayoutEffect` |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"`useEffect` runs asynchronously after the browser paints, so it doesn’t block rendering. `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after React updates the DOM but before the browser paints — it can read layout and prevent flicker. I use `useEffect` for most side effects like API calls, and `useLayoutEffect` when I need to measure or update the DOM before the user sees it. But I avoid `useLayoutEffect` for heavy logic since it blocks the main thread."_  

---

## 8. How can you trigger an effect only on component mount?

> Use `useEffect` with an **empty dependency array** (`[]`).

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs only once, after first render
  console.log("Component mounted");
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup on unmount
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  };
}, []); // ← Empty dependency array
```

---

### 🔹 8.1 Why This Works

- `useEffect` runs after render
- With `[]`, it **only runs when dependencies change**
- Since dependencies never change → runs **once**

✅ Equivalent to `componentDidMount` + `componentWillUnmount`

---

### 🔹 8.2 Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Initialize subscriptions | `socket.connect()` |
| ✅ Fetch initial data | `fetch('/api/data')` |
| ✅ Set up event listeners | `window.addEventListener('resize', ...)` |
| ✅ Start timers | `setInterval(...)` |
| ✅ Analytics tracking | `trackPageView()` |

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Forgetting `[]` → runs every render | Add empty array |
| Forgetting cleanup → memory leaks | Return cleanup function |
| Using async directly | Wrap async logic inside |

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api');
    setData(await res.json());
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"I use `useEffect` with an empty dependency array to run code only once after the component mounts. This is perfect for initializing subscriptions, fetching data, or setting up event listeners. I always include a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks — like removing event listeners or clearing intervals. This pattern replaces `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` in class components."_  

---

## 9. What is the significance of the dependency array in `useEffect`?

> The **dependency array** tells React **when to re-run** the effect.

It’s not optional — it’s **critical for correctness**.

---

### 🔹 9.1 Behavior Based on Dependency Array

| Dependency Array | When Effect Runs | Use Case |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| `[]` | Only on mount | Initialization, subscriptions |
| `[dep]` | When `dep` changes | Update based on props/state |
| **No array** | After every render | Rare (can cause infinite loops) |
| `[obj]` | When object reference changes | Watch for object mutations |

---

### 🔹 9.2 Why It Matters

#### 🟦 Correct: Dependencies Included
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `User: ${name}`;
}, [name]); // ✅ Re-runs when name changes
```

#### 🟦 Incorrect: Missing Dependency
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `User: ${name}`;
}, []); // ❌ Never updates title after first render
```

> ⚠️ ESLint plugin `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warns about this.

---

### 🔹 9.3 Objects and Arrays in Dependencies

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(user.name);
}, [user]); // ❌ Triggers on every render if user is recreated
```

✅ Fix: Use specific fields or `useMemo`
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(name);
}, [name]);
```

---

### 🔹 9.4 Performance vs Correctness

| Rule | Why |
|-----|-----|
| ✅ Always include all values used in the effect | Prevents stale closures |
| ✅ Use `useCallback`/`useMemo` to stabilize functions/objects | Avoid unnecessary re-renders |
| ✅ Don’t add dependencies just to silence ESLint | Can break logic |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The dependency array controls when `useEffect` runs. If a value is used inside the effect, it must be in the dependencies — otherwise, the effect may use stale data. I always include all dependencies to ensure correctness. For objects and functions, I use `useCallback` or `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary runs. The ESLint rule `exhaustive-deps` helps catch missing dependencies — I never ignore it without a good reason."_

## 10. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

| Feature | Controlled | Uncontrolled |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Source of Truth** | React state | DOM |
| **Value Management** | `value` + `onChange` | `defaultValue` + `ref` |
| **Validation** | Real-time (in React) | After submit (via `ref`) |
| **Use Case** | Forms with validation, dynamic UI | File inputs, third-party widgets |
| **Reactivity** | High (immediate updates) | Low (manual sync) |

---

### 🔹 10.1 Controlled Components

> Form data is handled by **React state**.

```jsx
function ControlledForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

  return (
    <input
      type="email"
      value={email}
      onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

✅ Pros:
- Full control
- Real-time validation
- Easy to test
- Can reset easily

❌ Cons:
- More boilerplate
- Performance cost for large forms

---

### 🔹 10.2 Uncontrolled Components

> Form data is handled by the **DOM** — accessed via `ref`.

```jsx
function UncontrolledForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input defaultValue="hello" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ Pros:
- Less code
- Better for file inputs (`<input type="file">`)
- Works with non-React widgets

❌ Cons:
- Harder to validate in real-time
- Cannot programmatically reset easily
- Not reactive

---

### 🔹 10.3 When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Component Type |
|--------|----------------|
| ✅ Login form with validation | Controlled |
| ✅ Search with live results | Controlled |
| ✅ File upload | Uncontrolled (`<input type="file">`) |
| ✅ Integrating with jQuery plugin | Uncontrolled |
| ✅ Large form with performance issues | Consider uncontrolled or `useRef` |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Controlled components use React state as the source of truth — the input's value is set by `value` and updated via `onChange`. Uncontrolled components use the DOM as the source of truth, accessed via `ref`. I use controlled components for forms with validation and dynamic behavior. For file inputs or integrating with non-React libraries, I use uncontrolled components. Controlled is the standard, but uncontrolled has its place when you need direct DOM access."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine concepts**:
> _"I use controlled components with `useState` for forms, `useEffect` for side effects, and proper `key` props in lists. I prefer `useEffect` over `useLayoutEffect` unless I need to measure layout."_  

That shows **deep, integrated understanding** — exactly what senior roles want.
