Each section includes:
- ✅ Clear definition
- ✅ In-depth explanation
- ✅ Memory/execution model
- ✅ Practical examples
- ✅ Common pitfalls
- ✅ Interview-ready answers

## 6. What is the `final` keyword in Java? How can it be used?

> The `final` keyword in Java is used to **restrict modification** — it enforces **immutability** and **design constraints**.

It can be applied to:
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Methods
- ✅ Classes

---

### 🔹 6.1 `final` Variable – Immutable Value

> Once assigned, a `final` variable **cannot be changed**.

```java
final int MAX_USERS = 100;
MAX_USERS = 200; // ❌ Compilation error
```

#### 🟦 Blank Final Variable
```java
class User {
    final String id;
    
    User(String id) {
        this.id = id; // ✅ Assigned in constructor
    }
}
```

✅ Must be assigned **exactly once** — either at declaration or in constructor.

#### 🟦 `final` Reference (Not Object)
```java
final List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Alice"); // ✅ OK — object is mutable
names = new ArrayList<>(); // ❌ Can't reassign reference
```

✅ The **reference** is immutable, not the object.

---

### 🔹 6.2 `final` Method – Cannot Be Overridden

> Prevents subclasses from overriding the method.

```java
class Vehicle {
    final void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // void start() { } // ❌ Compilation error
}
```

✅ Use to:
- Prevent breaking critical logic
- Security (e.g., `String` methods)

---

### 🔹 6.3 `final` Class – Cannot Be Inherited

> Prevents class from being extended.

```java
final class ImmutableConfig {
    // Can't be subclassed
}

// class CustomConfig extends ImmutableConfig { } // ❌ Error
```

✅ Common in:
- `String`, `Integer`, `LocalDateTime`
- Utility classes (`Math`, `Collections`)

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The `final` keyword enforces immutability and design constraints. A `final` variable can't be reassigned, a `final` method can't be overridden, and a `final` class can't be extended. I use `final` for constants, to prevent method overriding in security-sensitive code, and to make classes immutable. It helps write safer, more predictable code."_

## 7. What is method overloading and method overriding?

| Concept | Overloading | Overriding |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Same class | Inheritance (parent → child) |
| **Signature** | Same name, different params | Same name, same params |
| **Return Type** | Can be different | Must be same or covariant |
| **Binding** | Compile-time (static) | Runtime (dynamic) |
| **Purpose** | Multiple ways to call a method | Specialize inherited behavior |

---

### 🔹 7.1 Method Overloading – Compile-Time Polymorphism

> Multiple methods with the **same name but different parameters**.

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```

✅ Rules:
- Must differ in **parameter types**, **number**, or **order**
- Return type can differ
- Access modifier can differ

✅ Use for:
- Flexible APIs
- Different input types

---

### 🔹 7.2 Method Overriding – Runtime Polymorphism

> Subclass provides a **specific implementation** of a method already defined in superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

✅ Rules:
- Must have **same name, parameters, return type**
- Access modifier **cannot be more restrictive**
- `private`, `static`, `final` methods **cannot be overridden**

✅ Use with:
```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.makeSound(); // "Bark" → dynamic method dispatch
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Method overloading is having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters — resolved at compile time. Method overriding is when a subclass redefines a method from the superclass — resolved at runtime. Overloading is used for flexibility (e.g., multiple `add` methods), while overriding enables polymorphism (e.g., `Dog` overriding `makeSound`). I use `@Override` annotation to catch errors early."_

## 8. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?

| Feature | Interface | Abstract Class |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Methods** | Public abstract (Java 8: default/static) | Abstract + concrete |
| **Variables** | Public static final (constants) | Any access |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | ✅ Yes (`implements`) | ❌ No |
| **Inheritance** | `implements` | `extends` |
| **Constructors** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Access Modifiers** | `public` only | Any |
| **Use Case** | Define contracts, APIs | Shared code with partial implementation |

---

### 🔹 8.1 Interface – "What" (Contract)

> Defines **what a class can do**, not how.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly(); // public abstract by default

    default void land() {
        System.out.println("Landing");
    }

    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Flyable interface");
    }
}
```

✅ Since Java 8:
- `default` methods (concrete)
- `static` methods

✅ Use for:
- APIs
- Multiple inheritance
- Strategy pattern

---

### 🔹 8.2 Abstract Class – "What + How" (Partial Implementation)

> Can have **abstract and concrete methods**.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // Concrete method
    void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Breathing");
    }

    // Abstract method
    abstract void makeSound();
}
```

✅ Use for:
- Code reuse
- Shared state
- Template Method pattern

---

### 🔹 8.3 When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Choice |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Define a contract (e.g., `Comparable`) | Interface |
| ✅ Multiple inheritance needed | Interface |
| ✅ Shared code + state | Abstract Class |
| ✅ Force method implementation | Either |
| ✅ Utility methods in interface | `default` in Interface |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"An interface defines a contract — what a class can do — and supports multiple inheritance. Since Java 8, it can have `default` and `static` methods. An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, constructors, and instance variables — it's for code reuse. I use interfaces for APIs and polymorphism, and abstract classes when I need shared state or common logic. In modern Java, interfaces are more common due to default methods."_  

---

## 9. What is the `static` keyword? How is it used?

> The `static` keyword means **belonging to the class**, not to any instance.

Used with:
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Methods
- ✅ Blocks
- ✅ Nested Classes

---

### 🔹 9.1 `static` Variable – Class-Level State

> Shared across all instances.

```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // One copy for all objects

    Counter() {
        count++;
    }
}

Counter c1 = new Counter(); // count = 1
Counter c2 = new Counter(); // count = 2
```

✅ Memory: Loaded when class is loaded (before any object)

---

### 🔹 9.2 `static` Method – Class-Level Behavior

> Can be called without creating an object.

```java
class MathUtils {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

int sum = MathUtils.add(3, 4); // No object needed
```

✅ Rules:
- Can only access `static` members directly
- Cannot use `this` or `super`

✅ Use for:
- Utility methods (`Collections.sort()`)
- Factory methods

---

### 🔹 9.3 `static` Block – Class Initialization

> Runs once when class is loaded.

```java
static {
    System.out.println("Class loaded");
    // Initialize static variables
    loadConfig();
}
```

✅ Use for:
- One-time setup
- Loading native libraries
- Initializing complex static data

---

### 🔹 9.4 `static` Nested Class

> Nested class that doesn't depend on outer instance.

```java
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Static nested class");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
Outer.Inner inner = new Outer.Inner();
```

✅ No outer instance needed.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The `static` keyword means a member belongs to the class, not instances. `static` variables are shared across all objects. `static` methods can be called without creating an object — like `Math.max()`. `static` blocks run once when the class is loaded, useful for initialization. I use `static` for utility classes, constants, and one-time setup. But I avoid `static` for state in multi-threaded apps unless synchronized."_  

---

## 10. What is a package in Java?

> A **package** is a **namespace** that organizes related classes and interfaces.

It prevents naming conflicts and controls access.

---

### 🔹 10.1 Why Use Packages?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Avoid Name Conflicts** | `com.company.project.User` vs `com.another.User` |
| ✅ **Access Control** | `default` (package-private) access |
| ✅ **Modular Organization** | Group by feature (`auth`, `payment`) |
| ✅ **Easy Import** | `import java.util.List;` |

---

### 🔹 10.2 Package Declaration

```java
package com.bank.app.user;

public class User {
    // ...
}
```

✅ Must be the **first statement** in `.java` file  
✅ Directory structure must match: `com/bank/app/user/User.java`

---

### 🔹 10.3 Access Levels and Packages

| Modifier | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass | Anywhere |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `private` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **default** (package-private) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `protected` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (in or out) | ❌ |
| `public` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

✅ `default` access = only within the same package

---

### 🔹 10.4 Common Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `java.lang` | Core classes (`String`, `Object`, `System`) — imported by default |
| `java.util` | Utilities (`List`, `Map`, `Scanner`) |
| `java.io` | Input/Output |
| `java.net` | Networking |
| `java.sql` | Database |

---

### 🔹 10.5 Importing

```java
import java.util.ArrayList; // Single class
import java.util.*;         // All from package (not recommended)
```

✅ Best practice: Import specific classes.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A package is a namespace that groups related classes and prevents naming conflicts. It enables access control — package-private (default) members are only accessible within the same package. I organize code by feature (e.g., `com.app.user`, `com.app.payment`) and use packages to modularize large applications. Packages also make imports cleaner and reduce the risk of class name collisions."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine concepts**:
> _"I use `final` for immutability, `static` for utilities, interfaces for contracts, and packages for organization."_  

That shows **deep, integrated understanding** — exactly what senior roles want.
