## 21. What is synchronization? Why is it important in multithreading?

> **Synchronization** is the mechanism that **controls access to shared resources** by multiple threads to **prevent race conditions**.

Without it, **race conditions** can corrupt data.

---

### 🔹 21.1 What is a Race Condition?

When two or more threads access shared data **and try to change it at the same time**, the outcome depends on the **timing of execution**.

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    void increment() {
        count++; // Not atomic: read → modify → write
    }
}
```

✅ Problem:
- Thread A reads `count` (0)
- Thread B reads `count` (0)
- Both increment → write back 1
- Final `count = 1` (should be 2)

---

### 🔹 21.2 How Synchronization Works

Synchronization ensures **only one thread** can execute a **synchronized block or method** at a time.

#### 🟦 Synchronized Method
```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    synchronized void increment() {
        count++; // Now atomic
    }
}
```

#### 🟦 Synchronized Block
```java
synchronized (this) {
    count++;
}
```

✅ Uses an **implicit lock (monitor)** on the object.

---

### 🔹 21.3 Locks and Monitors

- Every object has a **monitor (lock)**
- When a thread enters a `synchronized` block/method, it **acquires the lock**
- Other threads **block** until the lock is released

---

### 🔹 21.4 Static Synchronization

> Lock on the **class**, not instance.

```java
static synchronized void staticMethod() {
    // Only one thread can run this across all instances
}
```

✅ Locks on `Counter.class`

---

### 🔹 21.5 Alternatives to `synchronized`

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|---------|
| `ReentrantLock` | More control (tryLock, fairness) |
| `AtomicInteger` | Lock-free thread-safe counters |
| `ConcurrentHashMap` | Thread-safe collections |

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet(); // Thread-safe, no locking
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Synchronization ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions. It’s crucial in multithreading because operations like `i++` aren’t atomic — multiple threads can interfere. I use `synchronized` methods or blocks, or modern tools like `AtomicInteger` and `ReentrantLock`. For collections, I prefer `ConcurrentHashMap` over synchronized wrappers."_  

---

## 22. What is the `volatile` keyword?

> `volatile` ensures that a variable’s value is **always read from and written to main memory**, not cached in thread-local memory.

It guarantees **visibility**, not **atomicity**.

---

### 🔹 22.1 The Problem: Thread Caching

Each thread may **cache variables** in CPU registers or cache.

```java
class Worker {
    boolean running = true;

    void run() {
        while (running) {
            // Do work
        }
    }

    void stop() {
        running = false; // May not be seen by worker thread!
    }
}
```

✅ Worker thread might **never see** the change to `running`

---

### 🔹 22.2 Solution: `volatile`

```java
volatile boolean running = true;
```

✅ Guarantees:
- Changes are **immediately visible** to all threads
- No thread-local caching
- **Happens-before** relationship

---

### 🔹 22.3 `volatile` vs `synchronized`

| Feature | `volatile` | `synchronized` |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Atomicity** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Visibility** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Performance** | Fast | Slower (blocking) |
| **Use Case** | Flag variables | Complex operations |

✅ Use `volatile` for:
- **Boolean flags** (e.g., `shutdown = true`)
- **Double-checked locking** in singleton

```java
private static volatile Singleton instance;
public static Singleton getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
        synchronized (Singleton.class) {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
        }
    }
    return instance;
}
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"`volatile` ensures a variable is read from and written to main memory, so changes are immediately visible to all threads. It guarantees visibility but not atomicity. I use it for boolean flags like `running` or in double-checked locking for singletons. For atomic operations, I use `synchronized` or `Atomic` classes."_  

---

## 23. What is the `this` keyword in Java?

> `this` refers to the **current instance** of the class.

It’s a **reference to the object** on which the method is being called.

---

### 🔹 23.1 Uses of `this`

#### 🟦 1. Resolve Name Shadowing
```java
class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name; // 'this.name' = field, 'name' = parameter
    }
}
```

#### 🟦 2. Call Another Constructor (Constructor Chaining)
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name) {
        this(name, 0); // Call other constructor
    }

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

#### 🟦 3. Pass Current Object
```java
void register() {
    EventManager.register(this); // Pass current object
}
```

#### 🟦 4. Return Current Object (Builder Pattern)
```java
Person setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this; // Enable chaining: p.setName("A").setAge(30)
}
```

---

### 🔹 23.2 `this` in Memory

```java
Person p = new Person("Alice");
// Inside Person methods, `this` → reference to p's object in heap
```

✅ `this` is **not stored** — it’s passed implicitly to every non-static method.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"`this` refers to the current object instance. I use it to resolve variable shadowing, call overloaded constructors, pass the object to other methods, or enable method chaining in builders. It’s essential for constructor chaining and clean APIs. `this` is passed implicitly to all instance methods and is not a variable — it’s a keyword."_  

---

## 24. What is constructor chaining?

> **Constructor chaining** is the process of **calling one constructor from another** within the same class or from the parent class.

It promotes **code reuse** and **reduces duplication**.

---

### 🔹 24.1 `this()` – Chain to Another Constructor in Same Class

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    String city;

    // Default
    Person() {
        this("Unknown", 0, "Unknown"); // Chain to full constructor
    }

    // Name only
    Person(String name) {
        this(name, 0, "Unknown");
    }

    // Full constructor
    Person(String name, int age, String city) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.city = city;
    }
}
```

✅ Rules:
- `this()` must be the **first statement**
- Only one `this()` per constructor

---

### 🔹 24.2 `super()` – Chain to Parent Constructor

```java
class Animal {
    String species;

    Animal(String species) {
        this.species = species;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String breed;

    Dog(String breed) {
        super("Canine"); // Call parent constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }
}
```

✅ Rules:
- `super()` must be the **first statement**
- If not called, compiler adds `super()` (no-arg)

---

### 🔹 24.3 Why Use Constructor Chaining?

| Benefit | Example |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Reduce code duplication | Set defaults in one place |
| ✅ Enforce consistency | All paths go through main constructor |
| ✅ Improve maintainability | Change logic in one constructor |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Constructor chaining is calling one constructor from another using `this()` or `super()`. `this()` calls another constructor in the same class — useful for default values. `super()` calls a parent constructor. I use it to avoid code duplication and ensure consistent object initialization. The call must be the first statement in the constructor."_  

---

## 25. What is autoboxing and unboxing?

> **Autoboxing** = automatic conversion from **primitive** to **wrapper object**  
> **Unboxing** = automatic conversion from **wrapper object** to **primitive**

Java does this automatically since **Java 5**.

---

### 🔹 25.1 Autoboxing (Primitive → Object)

```java
Integer a = 100; // ✅ Autoboxing: int → Integer
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(5); // ✅ Autoboxing: int → Integer
```

✅ Equivalent to:
```java
Integer a = Integer.valueOf(100);
```

---

### 🔹 25.2 Unboxing (Object → Primitive)

```java
Integer a = new Integer(100);
int b = a; // ✅ Unboxing: Integer → int
```

✅ Equivalent to:
```java
int b = a.intValue();
```

---

### 🔹 25.3 Common Pitfalls

#### 🟦 `NullPointerException` on Unboxing
```java
Integer count = null;
int c = count; // 💥 NullPointerException
```

✅ Fix:
```java
int c = (count != null) ? count : 0;
```

#### 🟦 Performance in Loops
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
int sum = 0;
for (Integer i : list) {
    sum += i; // Unboxing on every iteration
}
```

✅ Avoid in performance-critical code

#### 🟦 Caching (for small values)
```java
Integer a = 127;
Integer b = 127;
System.out.println(a == b); // true → cached

Integer c = 128;
Integer d = 128;
System.out.println(c == d); // false → not cached
```

✅ JVM caches `Integer` from -128 to 127

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Autoboxing converts primitives to wrapper objects (e.g., `int` → `Integer`) automatically. Unboxing does the reverse. I use it for collections like `List<Integer>`. But I’m careful — unboxing a `null` wrapper throws `NullPointerException`. Also, autoboxing in loops can hurt performance due to object creation. The JVM caches small `Integer` values (-128 to 127), so `==` works for them but not larger numbers."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine concepts**:
> _"I use `synchronized` for thread safety, `volatile` for flags, `this` for constructor chaining, and avoid `NullPointerException` from autoboxing."_  

That shows **deep, integrated understanding** — exactly what senior roles want.
