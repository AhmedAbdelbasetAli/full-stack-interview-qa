Adhering to **SOLID** principles ensures Java code remains **maintainable**, **extensible**, and **robust**. Let’s explore each principle with the structure you requested: **What it is**, **Why we need it**, **Which problems it solved**, **How to implement it**, and **Real-world examples**.

***

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**What it is**  
Each class should have **only one reason to change**—one responsibility or job.

**Why we need it**  
- Reduces coupling  
- Makes code easier to understand and test  
- Simplifies debugging and maintenance

**Problem it solved**  
Without SRP, classes become **God objects** that handle multiple concerns (e.g., data access, business logic, presentation), making them fragile and hard to modify.

**How to implement it**  
- Identify distinct responsibilities  
- Split classes into cohesive units  
- Use packages to group related classes

**Real-world example**  
A user registration feature:
- `UserValidator` handles input validation  
- `UserRepository` handles database persistence  
- `UserNotifier` sends confirmation emails  

```java
public class UserValidator {
    public void validate(User user) { /* validation logic */ }
}
public class UserRepository {
    public void save(User user) { /* JDBC or ORM code */ }
}
public class UserNotifier {
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(User user) { /* SMTP logic */ }
}
```

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**What it is**  
Software entities (classes, methods) should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

**Why we need it**  
- Enables adding new behavior without altering existing tested code  
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs when extending functionality

**Problem it solved**  
Changing existing code to add features often breaks existing tests and behavior.

**How to implement it**  
- Define abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes)  
- Rely on polymorphism rather than `if-else` or `switch` statements  
- Use dependency injection to supply new implementations

**Real-world example**  
Payment processing:
```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void process(Payment payment);
}
public class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(Payment payment) { /* credit card logic */ }
}
public class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(Payment payment) { /* PayPal logic */ }
}
// Adding new payment types requires creating new classes only:
public class CryptoProcessor implements PaymentProcessor { … }
```

***

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**What it is**  
Objects of a superclass should be **replaceable** with objects of a subclass **without altering** the correctness of the program.

**Why we need it**  
- Ensures subclasses behave in expected ways  
- Prevents surprising behavior when using inheritance

**Problem it solved**  
Violating LSP leads to runtime errors or unexpected results when a subclass fails to honor superclass contracts.

**How to implement it**  
- Subclass methods must honor preconditions and postconditions of the superclass  
- Avoid strengthening preconditions or weakening postconditions  
- Use interface contracts and meaningful exceptions

**Real-world example**  
Shapes hierarchy:
```java
public class Rectangle {
    protected int width, height;
    public void setWidth(int w) { width = w; }
    public void setHeight(int h) { height = h; }
    public int area() { return width * height; }
}
public class Square extends Rectangle {
    @Override
    public void setWidth(int w) {
        super.setWidth(w); super.setHeight(w);
    }
    @Override
    public void setHeight(int h) {
        super.setWidth(h); super.setHeight(h);
    }
}
// Violates LSP because setting width alone changes height unexpectedly.
```
Better design: extract `Shape` interface with separate `Rectangle` and `Square` classes each implementing its own area logic.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**What it is**  
Clients should **not be forced** to depend on interfaces they **do not use**.

**Why we need it**  
- Promotes fine-grained, role-specific interfaces  
- Reduces unnecessary dependencies  
- Improves code readability and testability

**Problem it solved**  
Large “fat” interfaces burden implementing classes with unused methods, increasing coupling and reducing cohesion.

**How to implement it**  
- Split large interfaces into smaller, client-specific interfaces  
- Implement only the methods needed for each role

**Real-world example**  
Device control interfaces:
```java
public interface Printer {
    void print(Document d);
}
public interface Scanner {
    void scan(Document d);
}
public interface Fax {
    void fax(Document d);
}
// Multi-function devices compose only the interfaces they need:
public class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printer, Scanner, Fax { … }
public class SimplePrinter implements Printer { … }
```

***

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**What it is**  
High-level modules should **not depend** on low-level modules; **both should depend** on **abstractions**. Abstractions should **not depend** on details; **details depend** on abstractions.

**Why we need it**  
- Decouples high-level logic from low-level implementations  
- Facilitates swapping implementations without changing business logic  
- Enhances testability via mocks and stubs

**Problem it solved**  
Tightly coupled code where high-level modules directly instantiate low-level classes, making changes difficult and tests cumbersome.

**How to implement it**  
- Use interfaces or abstract classes for dependencies  
- Apply dependency injection (constructor/setter/field)  
- Employ a DI container (Spring) for wiring components

**Real-world example**  
Order service using payment processors:
```java
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentProcessor processor;
    // Constructor injection
    public OrderService(PaymentProcessor processor) {
        this.processor = processor;
    }
    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Business logic...
        processor.process(order.getPayment());
    }
}
// Wire in Spring or manually:
PaymentProcessor pp = new CreditCardProcessor();
OrderService service = new OrderService(pp);
```

## **Benefits of SOLID**

- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and refactor  
- **Scalability**: Add new features with minimal impact  
- **Testability**: Clear interfaces enable unit testing with mocks  
- **Reusability**: Well-defined abstractions promote code reuse  
- **Robustness**: Reduces risk of unintended side-effects
