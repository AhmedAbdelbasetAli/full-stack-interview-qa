## **What is Multithreading in Java?****Multithreading** is a Java feature that allows **multiple threads** (lightweight sub-processes) to execute concurrently within the same program, sharing the same memory space but running independently. A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution that can run parallel to other threads.[1][2][3][4]

Think of a thread as a **separate line of execution** within your program that can perform tasks simultaneously with other threads.[2][4]

## **Why Do We Need Multithreading? What Problems Did It Solve?****Problems Before Multithreading**:[5][6][7]

1. **Sequential Execution**: Programs could only do one task at a time
2. **CPU Underutilization**: Modern multi-core processors weren't fully used  
3. **Poor Responsiveness**: Applications would freeze during long operations
4. **Inefficient I/O**: Programs waited idly during file/network operations
5. **Scalability Issues**: Server applications couldn't handle multiple users efficiently

**Benefits of Multithreading**:[2][6][4]

- **Better Performance**: Tasks run in parallel, reducing execution time
- **Improved Responsiveness**: UI remains interactive while background tasks run
- **Better CPU Utilization**: All processor cores are utilized effectively
- **Concurrent I/O**: Multiple file/network operations can happen simultaneously
- **Scalability**: Applications can handle more users and requests

**Real-world Example: Restaurant Kitchen**[1]Imagine a restaurant kitchen where:
- **Sequential cooking** (single-threaded): One chef prepares entire meals one by one
- **Multithreaded cooking**: Multiple chefs work simultaneously - one prepares appetizers, another makes main courses, another handles desserts

This parallel approach serves customers much faster and utilizes all available chefs (CPU cores) efficiently.

## **Thread Lifecycle: The Journey of a Thread**Every Java thread goes through specific states during its lifetime:[8][9][10]

### **Thread States**:[9][10][11][8]1. **NEW**: Thread created but not started
2. **RUNNABLE**: Ready to run or currently running  
3. **BLOCKED**: Waiting for a monitor lock
4. **WAITING**: Waiting indefinitely for another thread
5. **TIMED_WAITING**: Waiting for a specified time
6. **TERMINATED**: Thread execution completed

**State Transitions**:[8][9]
- **NEW → RUNNABLE**: Call `start()` method
- **RUNNABLE → RUNNING**: Thread scheduler assigns CPU
- **RUNNING → BLOCKED**: Tries to access locked resource
- **BLOCKED → RUNNABLE**: Acquires the lock
- **RUNNING → WAITING**: Calls `wait()`, `join()`
- **WAITING → RUNNABLE**: Another thread calls `notify()`
- **RUNNING → TERMINATED**: `run()` method completes

## **How to Implement Threads in Java**Java provides **two main approaches** to create threads:[12][13][14]

### **Method 1: Extending Thread Class**```java
// Extending Thread class
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    private String taskName;
    
    public MyThread(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // This code runs in a separate thread
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(taskName + " - Count: " + i + 
                             " [Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "]");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
        System.out.println(taskName + " completed!");
    }
}

// Using the thread
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create thread objects
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread("Task-1");
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread("Task-2");
        
        // Start threads (calls run() method internally)
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        
        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
    }
}
```

### **Method 2: Implementing Runnable Interface (Recommended)**[12][13][14]```java
// Implementing Runnable interface
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;
    
    public MyRunnable(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(taskName + " - Count: " + i + 
                             " [Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + "]");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(taskName + " completed!");
    }
}

// Using Runnable
public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create Runnable objects
        MyRunnable task1 = new MyRunnable("Task-1");
        MyRunnable task2 = new MyRunnable("Task-2");
        
        // Create Thread objects with Runnable
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);
        
        // Start threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        
        // Lambda expression (Java 8+)
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Lambda task running in: " + 
                             Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });
        thread3.start();
    }
}
```

**Why Runnable is Better?**:[12][15]
- **Composition over Inheritance**: More flexible design
- **Multiple Interface Implementation**: Class can implement other interfaces
- **Thread Pooling**: Runnable objects work better with ExecutorService
- **Separation of Concerns**: Task logic separated from thread management

## **Thread Synchronization: Avoiding Chaos****The Problem: Race Conditions**[16]When multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously without proper coordination, **race conditions** occur.[16]



**Race Condition Example:**

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    
    // Unsafe method - race condition possible
    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            // Thread might be interrupted here!
            System.out.println("Withdrawing: " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("New balance: " + balance);
        }
    }
}

public class RaceConditionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        
        // Two threads trying to withdraw simultaneously
        Thread user1 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(600), "User-1");
        Thread user2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(500), "User-2");
        
        user1.start();
        user2.start();
        
        // Possible output: Both withdrawals succeed, negative balance!
    }
}
```

**The Solution: Synchronized Methods**

```java
public class SafeBankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    
    // Synchronized method - only one thread at a time
    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + 
                             " withdrawing: " + amount);
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds for " + 
                             Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
```

**Synchronized Block Example:**

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();
    
    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++; // Only one thread can execute this at a time
        }
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

## **Thread Pools: Managing Threads Efficiently**Creating new threads for every task is expensive. **Thread pools** reuse existing threads.[17][18][19]

**ExecutorService Example**:[18][20][17]

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        
        // Submit 10 tasks to the pool
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            final int taskNumber = i;
            
            executor.submit(() -> {
                String threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + 
                                 " executed by " + threadName);
                
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + " completed");
            });
        }
        
        // Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();
        
        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to complete
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }
        
        System.out.println("All tasks completed!");
    }
}
```

**Types of Thread Pools**:[19][20][17]

```java
// Fixed size pool - exactly 5 threads
ExecutorService fixed = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

// Cached pool - creates threads as needed, reuses available ones
ExecutorService cached = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

// Single thread pool - tasks executed sequentially
ExecutorService single = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

// Scheduled pool - for delayed/periodic tasks
ScheduledExecutorService scheduled = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
```

## **Common Threading Problems**### **1. Deadlock**[16][21]When two or more threads wait for each other indefinitely:

```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock1...");
            
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock2...");
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding both locks!");
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock2...");
            
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock1...");
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding both locks!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Deadlock Prevention:**
- Always acquire locks in the same order
- Use timeouts with `tryLock()`
- Avoid nested locks when possible

### **2. Thread Starvation**When a thread never gets CPU time due to higher priority threads.

**Solution**: Use fair locks or adjust thread priorities carefully.

## **Best Practices for Java Threading**[22][4]1. **Use Thread Pools**: Don't create threads manually for every task
2. **Prefer Runnable**: Implement Runnable instead of extending Thread
3. **Avoid Shared Mutable State**: Minimize shared data between threads
4. **Use Concurrent Collections**: `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`
5. **Handle Interruptions**: Properly handle `InterruptedException`
6. **Use Atomic Classes**: `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean` for simple operations
7. **Avoid `stop()`, `suspend()`, `resume()`**: These methods are deprecated

**Modern Concurrency Utilities**:

```java
// Atomic operations
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
counter.incrementAndGet(); // Thread-safe

// Concurrent collections
ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

// CountDownLatch - wait for multiple threads
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

// Semaphore - control access to resources
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2);
```

## **Real-World Threading Examples**### **Web Server Example:**```java
public class SimpleWebServer {
    private final ExecutorService threadPool;
    
    public SimpleWebServer(int threadCount) {
        this.threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(threadCount);
    }
    
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        threadPool.submit(() -> {
            // Each request handled in separate thread
            processRequest(request);
        });
    }
    
    private void processRequest(String request) {
        // Simulate request processing
        System.out.println("Processing: " + request + 
                         " in " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Database query, file I/O, etc.
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        System.out.println("Completed: " + request);
    }
}
```

### **Producer-Consumer Example:**```java
public class ProducerConsumerExample {
    private final BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10);
    
    class Producer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
                    String item = "Item-" + i;
                    queue.put(item); // Blocks if queue is full
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
    
    class Consumer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    String item = queue.take(); // Blocks if queue is empty
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
                    Thread.sleep(200);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void start() {
        Thread producer = new Thread(new Producer());
        Thread consumer1 = new Thread(new Consumer());
        Thread consumer2 = new Thread(new Consumer());
        
        producer.start();
        consumer1.start();
        consumer2.start();
    }
}
```
