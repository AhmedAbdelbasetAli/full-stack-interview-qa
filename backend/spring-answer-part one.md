## 1. What is the Spring Framework? What are its main features?

> **Spring Framework** is a **comprehensive programming and configuration model** for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

It’s not a single library — it’s a **platform** that simplifies development with **modular, reusable components**.

---

### 🔹 1.1 Core Features

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container** | Manages object creation and lifecycle |
| ✅ **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Injects dependencies automatically |
| ✅ **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** | Cross-cutting concerns (logging, security) |
| ✅ **Spring MVC** | Web & REST API development |
| ✅ **Spring Data** | Simplifies data access (JPA, MongoDB) |
| ✅ **Spring Security** | Authentication and authorization |
| ✅ **Spring Boot** | Auto-configuration, standalone apps |
| ✅ **Transaction Management** | Declarative transactions with `@Transactional` |

---

### 🔹 1.2 Why Use Spring?

| Problem | Spring Solution |
|--------|-----------------|
| ❌ Manual object creation and wiring | ✅ IoC Container |
| ❌ Tight coupling between classes | ✅ Dependency Injection |
| ❌ Boilerplate for transactions, logging | ✅ AOP & `@Transactional` |
| ❌ Complex web development | ✅ Spring MVC & REST |
| ❌ Database access code | ✅ Spring Data JPA |

---

### 🔹 1.3 Spring vs Spring Boot

| Feature | Spring | Spring Boot |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Configuration | XML or Java config | Auto-configuration |
| Setup | Manual | Embedded server, starters |
| Use Case | Full control | Rapid development |

✅ **Spring Boot** = **Spring + Conventions + Auto-configuration**

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Spring is a modular framework for enterprise Java applications. Its core features include IoC for object management, DI for loose coupling, AOP for cross-cutting concerns, and modules for web, data, and security. Spring Boot simplifies it with auto-configuration and embedded servers. I use Spring to build scalable, maintainable systems with clean separation of concerns."_  

---

## 2. What is Inversion of Control (IoC)? How does Spring implement it?

> **Inversion of Control (IoC)** means **letting a container manage object creation and lifecycle**, instead of doing it manually.

Instead of:
```java
Service service = new Service();
Controller controller = new Controller(service);
```

You say:
```java
@Controller
class MyController {
    @Autowired
    private Service service; // Container injects it
}
```

✅ The **container controls the flow** — hence "Inversion".

---

### 🔹 2.1 How Spring Implements IoC

Spring uses the **IoC Container** — two main implementations:

| Container | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| `BeanFactory` | Basic container (lightweight) |
| `ApplicationContext` | Full-featured (most common) |

#### 🟦 Steps:
1. **Configuration**: Define beans (via annotations, XML, or Java config)
2. **Container Startup**: Spring reads config and creates beans
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Injects dependencies
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Handles `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`

```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
MyService service = context.getBean(MyService.class);
```

---

### 🔹 2.2 Example: IoC in Action

```java
@Component
class EmailService {
    void send(String to, String msg) {
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + to);
    }
}

@Component
class NotificationService {
    @Autowired
    private EmailService emailService;

    void notify(String user) {
        emailService.send(user, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

✅ Spring creates both beans and injects `EmailService` into `NotificationService`.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Inversion of Control means the framework, not the developer, controls object creation and wiring. Spring implements it via the IoC Container (`ApplicationContext`), which reads configuration, creates beans, and manages their lifecycle. This reduces coupling and makes the system more modular and testable."_  

---

## 3. What is Dependency Injection (DI)? Give an example in Spring.

> **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a **design pattern** where **dependencies are provided to a class**, rather than the class creating them.

It’s a **key part of IoC**.

---

### 🔹 3.1 Types of DI in Spring

| Type | Example |
|------|--------|
| **Constructor Injection** | `public Service(Repo repo)` |
| **Setter Injection** | `setRepo(Repo repo)` |
| **Field Injection** | `@Autowired private Repo repo;` |

✅ **Constructor Injection** is preferred — immutable, testable.

---

### 🔹 3.2 Example: Constructor Injection (Recommended)

```java
@Service
class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    // Constructor injection
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User findById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }
}
```

✅ Spring automatically injects `UserRepository` if it’s a bean.

---

### 🔹 3.3 Field Injection (Not Recommended)

```java
@Service
class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository; // ❌ Avoid
}
```

❌ Why avoid:
- Breaks immutability
- Hard to test (can’t inject in constructor)
- Can’t be `final`
- Hidden dependencies

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Dependency Injection is providing dependencies to a class from outside, rather than creating them inside. In Spring, I use constructor injection — it’s immutable, testable, and clear. For example, I inject `UserRepository` into `UserService` via constructor. I avoid field injection because it hides dependencies and makes testing harder."_  

---

## 4. What is the `@Autowired` annotation? How does it work?

> `@Autowired` tells Spring to **automatically inject a bean** of the required type.

It’s the **primary DI mechanism** in Spring.

---

### 🔹 4.1 How `@Autowired` Works

Spring’s **dependency injection container**:
1. Scans for `@Component`, `@Service`, etc. → registers beans
2. Finds `@Autowired` fields/methods/constructors
3. Resolves dependencies by **type**
4. If multiple beans of same type → uses `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`

---

### 🔹 4.2 Where Can You Use `@Autowired`?

| Location | Example |
|--------|--------|
| **Field** | `@Autowired private Service service;` |
| **Constructor** | `@Autowired public Controller(Service s)` |
| **Setter** | `@Autowired public void setService(Service s)` |
| **Method Parameters** | `@EventListener @Autowired void handle(Event e)` |

✅ **Constructor with one arg** → `@Autowired` optional (Spring 4.3+)

---

### 🔹 4.3 Handling Multiple Beans

```java
@Component
@Primary
class EmailService implements NotificationService { ... }

@Component
class SMSService implements NotificationService { ... }

@Service
class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private NotificationService service; // Injects @Primary (EmailService)
}
```

Or use `@Qualifier`:
```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("sMSService")
private NotificationService service;
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"`@Autowired` tells Spring to inject a bean of the matching type. It works by type matching — if multiple beans exist, I use `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`. I prefer constructor injection, where `@Autowired` is optional for single constructors. It reduces boilerplate and makes dependencies explicit."_  

---

## 5. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?

All are **stereotypes** — specializations of `@Component`.

| Annotation | Purpose | Special Behavior |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| `@Component` | Generic Spring-managed bean | None |
| `@Service` | Business logic layer | None (semantic only) |
| `@Repository` | Data access layer | **Automatic exception translation** |
| `@Controller` | Web layer (Spring MVC) | Handles HTTP requests |

---

### 🔹 5.1 `@Component` – The Base

```java
@Component
class RandomGenerator { ... }
```

✅ Any class that should be a Spring bean.

---

### 🔹 5.2 `@Service` – Business Logic

```java
@Service
class UserService {
    // Business logic
}
```

✅ **Semantic** — no special behavior, but improves readability.

---

### 🔹 5.3 `@Repository` – Data Access

```java
@Repository
class UserRepository {
    // JPA, JDBC, etc.
}
```

✅ **Special Behavior**:
- **Exception Translation**: Converts `SQLException` → `DataAccessException`
- Marked for component scanning

---

### 🔹 5.4 `@Controller` – Web Layer

```java
@Controller
class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/users")
    String listUsers(Model model) { ... }
}
```

✅ Used in **Spring MVC** to handle HTTP requests.

> 🔁 Also has `@RestController` = `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`

---

### 🔹 5.5 Are They Interchangeable?

✅ **Yes** — Spring treats them all as `@Component`  
❌ **But** you lose semantics and special behavior

> ❌ Don’t use `@Component` on a repo — you lose exception translation

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"`@Component` is the base stereotype for any Spring-managed bean. `@Service` marks business logic, `@Repository` marks data access (with automatic exception translation), and `@Controller` marks web controllers. They’re all `@Component` under the hood, but using the right one improves code clarity and enables Spring features like exception translation in repositories."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine concepts**:
> _"I use `@Repository` for data access with automatic exception handling, `@Service` for business logic with constructor injection, and `@Controller` for REST endpoints."_  

That shows **deep, integrated understanding** — exactly what senior roles want.
