## 1. What are the stages in a typical CI/CD pipeline?

> A **CI/CD pipeline** automates the process of **building, testing, and deploying** code.

### ✅ Typical Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Tools Example |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1. **Source** | Monitor version control (Git) for changes | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket |
| 2. **Build** | Compile code, install dependencies | Maven, Gradle, npm, Docker |
| 3. **Test** | Run unit, integration, security tests | JUnit, TestNG, Jest, OWASP ZAP |
| 4. **Package** | Create deployable artifact (JAR, Docker image) | Docker, Maven, webpack |
| 5. **Deploy to Staging** | Deploy to test environment | Kubernetes, EC2, Heroku |
| 6. **Run Integration/E2E Tests** | Test full system behavior | Selenium, Cypress, Postman |
| 7. **Manual Approval (Optional)** | Human gate before production | Jira, Slack approval |
| 8. **Deploy to Production** | Release to users | Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling |
| 9. **Monitor & Rollback** | Observe health, rollback if needed | CloudWatch, Prometheus, Sentry |

### 🔹 Example: Java Spring Boot Pipeline

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  ci-cd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1. Build
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean package

      # 2. Test
      - name: Run Tests
        run: mvn test

      # 3. Package (Docker)
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .

      # 4. Push to Registry
      - name: Push to ECR
        run: |
          aws ecr get-login-password | docker login ...
          docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}

      # 5. Deploy to Staging (via AWS CodeDeploy or kubectl)
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }} --namespace=staging

      # 6. Manual Approval
      - name: Wait for Approval
        uses: trilom/file-changes-action@v1
        id: check
      - name: Approve Deployment
        if: steps.check.outputs.files_changed == 'true'
        run: echo "Proceed to production"

      # 7. Deploy to Production
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }} --namespace=prod
```

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A typical CI/CD pipeline has: Source → Build → Test → Package → Deploy to Staging → Integration Tests → Manual Approval → Deploy to Production → Monitor. I use it to automate testing and deployment, catch bugs early, and release faster with confidence."_  

---

## 2. Why should you run tests before deployment?

> Running tests **before deployment** ensures that:
- ✅ The code **works as expected**
- ✅ **No regressions** were introduced
- ✅ **Critical bugs** are caught early
- ✅ **Quality gate** is enforced

---

### 🔹 Risks of Skipping Tests

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| ❌ **Production Bugs** | Poor user experience, lost revenue |
| ❌ **Broken Deployments** | Downtime, rollback needed |
| ❌ **Security Vulnerabilities** | Exploitable flaws |
| ❌ **Low Team Velocity** | More time fixing bugs than building features |

---

### 🔹 Types of Tests in CI/CD

| Test Type | When to Run | Purpose |
|---------|------------|--------|
| ✅ **Unit Tests** | After build | Test individual methods/classes |
| ✅ **Integration Tests** | After unit | Test service-to-service interaction |
| ✅ **Security Scans** | During build | Find vulnerabilities (Snyk, OWASP) |
| ✅ **End-to-End (E2E)** | After staging deploy | Test full user flow |
| ✅ **Performance Tests** | Pre-production | Check under load |

---

### 📌 Best Practices

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| ✅ **Fail the build on test failure** | Enforce quality |
| ✅ **Run fast tests first** | Fail fast |
| ✅ **Use parallel test execution** | Reduce pipeline time |
| ✅ **Test in staging environment** | Catch env-specific issues |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"I run tests before deployment to catch bugs early and prevent broken releases. Unit tests verify logic, integration tests check services work together, and E2E tests validate user flows. If any test fails, the pipeline stops. This ensures only high-quality code reaches production."_  

---

## 3. What is a build artifact?

> A **build artifact** is the **output of the build process** — a **deployable package** that can be run in any environment.

It’s **immutable** and **versioned**.

---

### ✅ Examples by Language

| Language | Artifact |
|--------|---------|
| **Java** | `.jar`, `.war` file |
| **Node.js** | Bundled JS (with `webpack`), Docker image |
| **Python** | `.whl`, `.tar.gz`, Docker image |
| **Go** | Compiled binary |
| **Frontend** | Minified `dist/` folder |
| **All** | **Docker image** (most common in cloud) |

---

### ✅ Why Artifacts Matter

| Benefit | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Immutable** | Same artifact used in staging and production — no "works on my machine" |
| ✅ **Versioned** | Tagged with Git SHA or version (e.g., `myapp:v1.2.3`) |
| ✅ **Reusable** | Deploy same artifact across environments |
| ✅ **Traceable** | Know exactly what code is running |
| ✅ **Efficient** | Build once, deploy many times |

---

### 🔹 Example: Docker as Artifact

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/myapp.jar /app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

✅ Build once:
```bash
docker build -t myapp:abc123 .
```

✅ Deploy to staging and production using the **same image**.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A build artifact is the output of the build — like a JAR file or Docker image. It's immutable and versioned. I use Docker images as artifacts because they include everything needed to run. I build once, then deploy the same image to staging and production to ensure consistency."_  

---

## 4. How do you secure secrets (e.g., API keys) in CI/CD?

> **Never hardcode secrets** in code or config files.

Use **secure secret management** in your CI/CD system.

---

### ✅ Best Practices

| Method | How | Tools |
|-------|-----|-------|
| ✅ **CI/CD Secret Store** | Encrypt secrets in pipeline | GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables, AWS CodeBuild |
| ✅ **External Secret Manager** | Fetch at runtime | AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault |
| ✅ **Environment Variables** | Inject secrets as env vars | But don’t log them! |
| ✅ **Short-Lived Tokens** | Use OAuth, JWT instead of long-lived keys | |

---

### 🔹 Example: GitHub Actions with Secrets

```yaml
- name: Set AWS Credentials
  run: |
    aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
```

✅ `secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY` is **encrypted** and only available at runtime.

---

### 🔹 Example: AWS CodeBuild with Parameter Store

```yaml
# buildspec.yml
env:
  secrets-manager:
    DB_PASSWORD: "prod/db-password"

phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Deploying with secure DB password"
```

✅ Secret fetched from **SSM Parameter Store**.

---

### 📌 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|----------------|--------|
| Hardcoded in code | Use CI/CD secrets |
| Committed `.env` file | Add to `.gitignore` |
| Logging secrets | Mask in logs |
| Long-lived API keys | Use short-lived tokens or IAM roles |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"I never hardcode secrets. In CI/CD, I use encrypted secret stores like GitHub Secrets or AWS Parameter Store. I inject them as environment variables at runtime. For production, I prefer IAM roles over keys. I also use short-lived tokens and rotate secrets regularly."_  

---

## 5. What is a deployment trigger?

> A **deployment trigger** is an **event that starts a deployment**.

It automates the release process.

---

### ✅ Common Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ **Git Push/PR Merge** | Push to `main` branch → deploy to staging |
| ✅ **Successful Build** | After tests pass → deploy to staging |
| ✅ **Manual Approval** | Click "Deploy to Prod" in UI |
| ✅ **Scheduled Time** | Deploy at 2 AM on Sunday |
| ✅ **Artifact Published** | New Docker image in registry → deploy |
| ✅ **Health Check Passed** | After canary deployment → promote to all |

---

### 🔹 Example: Trigger Flow

```text
[Push to main] → [CI Pipeline] → [Tests Pass] → [Deploy to Staging] → [E2E Tests] → [Manual Approval] → [Deploy to Production]
```

✅ Each step can be a trigger for the next.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A deployment trigger is what starts a deployment — like a Git push, successful test, or manual approval. I use automated triggers for staging, and manual triggers for production to ensure control. Triggers make deployments consistent and repeatable."_  

---

## 6. What is a webhook in CI/CD?

> A **webhook** is an **HTTP callback** — a way for one system to **notify another** when an event happens.

It’s how **external events trigger CI/CD pipelines**.

---

### ✅ How Webhooks Work

```
[Event: Push to GitHub] → [GitHub sends POST to CI server] → [CI/CD Pipeline Starts]
```

- GitHub → CI server (Jenkins, GitLab CI)
- Docker Hub → Kubernetes (image updated)
- Slack → Custom bot (command issued)

---

### 🔹 Example: GitHub Webhook to Jenkins

1. You push code to GitHub
2. GitHub sends a `POST` request to `https://jenkins.mycompany.com/github-webhook/`
3. Jenkins receives it and **triggers a build**

✅ No polling needed — instant reaction.

---

### 🔹 Webhook Payload Example (GitHub)

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "after": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "repository": {
    "name": "myapp",
    "clone_url": "https://github.com/user/myapp.git"
  }
}
```

✅ CI system uses this to check out the right code.

---

### 📌 Best Practices

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| ✅ **Use HTTPS** | Secure the payload |
| ✅ **Add Secret Token** | Verify sender (GitHub: "Secret" field) |
| ✅ **Validate Payload** | Check `ref`, `repository` |
| ✅ **Idempotency** | Handle duplicate webhooks safely |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A webhook is an HTTP callback that notifies a system when an event occurs. In CI/CD, GitHub sends a webhook to Jenkins when I push code, triggering a build. I secure it with HTTPS and a secret token to prevent unauthorized triggers. It’s event-driven and faster than polling."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine concepts**:
> _"I use webhooks to trigger CI/CD on Git push, run tests before deployment, package a Docker artifact, secure secrets with AWS Parameter Store, and deploy via manual trigger."_  

That shows **deep, integrated DevOps knowledge**.
