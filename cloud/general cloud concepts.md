## 1. What is cloud computing? What are the main service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)?

> **Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources** (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

It eliminates the need to buy and maintain physical hardware.

---

### 🔹 1.1 The Three Main Service Models

| Model | Full Name | What You Manage | What the Cloud Manages | Example |
|------|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **IaaS** | Infrastructure as a Service | OS, Apps, Data | Servers, Storage, Network | AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine |
| **PaaS** | Platform as a Service | Apps, Data | Runtime, OS, Virtualization | Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** | Software as a Service | Nothing — just use it | Everything | Gmail, Slack, Salesforce |

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Cloud computing delivers IT resources over the internet with on-demand pricing. The three models are IaaS (you manage OS/apps), PaaS (you deploy code, cloud handles runtime), and SaaS (you just use the software). I use IaaS for full control, PaaS for faster deployment, and SaaS for business tools. The choice depends on control vs. convenience."_

## 2. What are the benefits of cloud computing over on-premise infrastructure?

| Benefit | Cloud | On-Premise |
|--------|------|-----------|
| ✅ **Cost Efficiency** | Pay-as-you-go — no upfront hardware costs | High CapEx (servers, data center) |
| ✅ **Scalability** | Auto-scale in minutes | Manual, slow scaling |
| ✅ **Global Reach** | Deploy in 30+ regions worldwide | Limited to physical locations |
| ✅ **High Availability** | Built-in redundancy across AZs | Expensive to replicate |
| ✅ **Speed & Agility** | Spin up servers in seconds | Weeks to provision |
| ✅ **Managed Services** | RDS, Lambda, Cloud Functions | You manage everything |
| ✅ **Security & Compliance** | Cloud provider handles physical security | You handle all security |
| ✅ **Disaster Recovery** | Easy backups, snapshots, replication | Complex and costly |

---

### 🔹 2.1 Example: Launching a Web App

| Step | On-Premise | Cloud |
|------|----------|-------|
| Buy servers | 4 weeks, $50k | 1 minute, $0.01/hr |
| Set up network | Manual VLANs, firewalls | VPC with click |
| Scale during traffic spike | Call vendor → wait 2 weeks | Auto-scaling group |
| Disaster recovery | Tape backups | S3 versioning + cross-region replication |

✅ Cloud wins on **speed, cost, and resilience**.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Cloud computing offers cost savings (no upfront hardware), instant scalability, global reach, and managed services. Unlike on-premise, I can scale from 1 to 1000 servers in minutes. I get built-in high availability across zones, automated backups, and access to AI/ML tools. This agility is why companies migrate to cloud — it’s faster, cheaper, and more reliable."_  

---

## 3. What is the shared responsibility model in cloud security?

> The **Shared Responsibility Model** defines **who is responsible for security** — the **cloud provider** or the **customer**.

It depends on the **service model**.

---

### 🔹 3.1 Responsibility by Model

| Responsibility | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **Physical Security** | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud |
| **Network Infrastructure** | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud |
| **Guest OS & Patching** | ✅ Customer | ✅ Cloud | ✅ Cloud |
| **Applications & Data** | ✅ Customer | ✅ Customer | ✅ Cloud |
| **Access Control (IAM)** | ✅ Customer | ✅ Customer | ✅ Customer |
| **Firewall & Security Groups** | ✅ Customer | ✅ Customer | ✅ Cloud |
| **Data Encryption** | ✅ Customer (manage keys) | ✅ Cloud (or customer) | ✅ Cloud |

---

### 🔹 3.2 Example: AWS EC2 (IaaS)

```
AWS is responsible for:
  - Data center security
  - Host OS, networking hardware

You are responsible for:
  - Guest OS updates
  - Firewall rules (Security Groups)
  - Application security
  - Data encryption
  - IAM users and roles
```

✅ You **cannot blame AWS** if you leave an S3 bucket public.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"The shared responsibility model splits security between the cloud provider and customer. In IaaS, the provider secures the physical infrastructure, but I secure the OS, apps, and data. In PaaS, they manage more — like runtime and OS. In SaaS, they handle almost everything. I always follow the model — for example, in AWS EC2, I patch the OS and configure security groups, while AWS handles the hypervisor."_  

---

## 4. What is auto-scaling? How does it work in the cloud?

> **Auto-scaling** automatically **adds or removes compute resources** based on demand — ensuring **performance** and **cost efficiency**.

---

### 🔹 4.1 How Auto-Scaling Works

```
[User Traffic] → [CloudWatch / Metrics] → [Auto Scaling Group] → [Add/Remove EC2 Instances]
```

#### 🟦 Components
- **Launch Template/Configuration**: Defines instance type, AMI, security groups
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Manages instance pool
- **Scaling Policies**:
  - **Target Tracking**: Maintain CPU at 60%
  - **Step Scaling**: Add 2 instances if CPU > 70%
  - **Scheduled Scaling**: Scale up during Black Friday

---

### 🔹 4.2 Example: Web App Scaling

```text
Normal: 2 instances → 50% CPU
Traffic spike: CPU → 85%
Auto Scaling: Launch 2 more instances
Load Balancer: Distribute traffic
After 10 mins: CPU drops → terminate extra instances
```

✅ Scales **out** (add) and **in** (remove)

---

### 🔹 4.3 Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **High Availability** | Always enough instances |
| ✅ **Cost Efficiency** | No over-provisioning |
| ✅ **Performance** | Handles traffic spikes |
| ✅ **Resilience** | Replaces unhealthy instances |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of servers based on metrics like CPU or request count. In AWS, I use Auto Scaling Groups with CloudWatch alarms. When CPU exceeds 70%, it launches new EC2 instances and registers them with the load balancer. When traffic drops, it terminates them. This ensures performance during peaks and saves cost during lows."_  

---

## 5. What is a Region and Availability Zone (AZ) in cloud platforms?

> **Regions** and **Availability Zones (AZs)** are the foundation of **high availability** and **disaster recovery** in the cloud.

---

### 🔹 5.1 Region

> A **geographic location** where the cloud provider has **data centers**.

- Examples: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `eu-west-1` (Ireland)
- Typically **hundreds of miles apart**
- Used for **latency optimization** and **data residency**

✅ Deploy in a region close to your users.

---

### 🔹 5.2 Availability Zone (AZ)

> An **isolated data center** within a region with:
- Independent power
- Independent cooling
- Independent networking

- A region has **2–6 AZs**
- AZs are connected via **low-latency links**

```
Region: us-east-1
├── AZ-a: Data Center 1
├── AZ-b: Data Center 2
└── AZ-c: Data Center 3
```

✅ Deploy your app across **multiple AZs** for fault tolerance.

---

### 🔹 5.3 Why Use Multiple AZs?

| Scenario | Single AZ | Multi-AZ |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Power failure in DC | ❌ Entire app down | ✅ Other AZs keep running |
| Network outage | ❌ App unreachable | ✅ Failover to healthy AZ |
| Maintenance | ❌ Downtime | ✅ Zero downtime |

✅ Multi-AZ → **High Availability**

---

### 🔹 5.4 Example: Highly Available Architecture

```
[User] → [Route 53 (DNS)] → [Application Load Balancer (Multi-AZ)]
                                 ↓
                 [EC2 Instances in AZ-a, AZ-b, AZ-c]
                                 ↓
                    [RDS Multi-AZ Database]
```

✅ If AZ-a fails → ALB routes to AZ-b and AZ-c

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A Region is a geographic area with data centers (e.g., us-east-1). An Availability Zone (AZ) is an isolated data center within a region with independent power and network. I deploy applications across multiple AZs to ensure high availability — if one fails, others keep the app running. This is key for 99.9%+ uptime SLAs."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **draw the architecture**:
> ```
> User → Region (us-east-1) → AZ-a, AZ-b → Auto Scaling Group → Load Balancer
> ```

> This shows you understand **real-world cloud design**.
