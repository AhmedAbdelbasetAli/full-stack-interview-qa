## üèÜ The 10 Most Famous SQL Interview Questions

---

### 1. **Second Highest Salary**  
**LeetCode**: [176. Second Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)  
**Problem**: Find the second highest salary. Return `NULL` if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
**Why Famous**: Tests knowledge of `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT/OFFSET`, and **handling edge cases**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1`  
- Scalar subquery returns `NULL` naturally  
- Avoid using `WHERE` with aggregates  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary 
    FROM Employee 
    ORDER BY salary DESC 
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

**Problem**: Find employees whose salary is higher than their manager‚Äôs.  
**Why Famous**: Classic **self-join** problem.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Self-join on `id` and `managerId`  
- Compare values across rows  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
```

---

### 3. **Duplicate Emails**  
**LeetCode**: [182. Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/)  
**Problem**: Report all duplicate emails.  
**Why Famous**: Simple but tests `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- `GROUP BY email`  
- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT email AS Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

### 4. **Customers Who Never Order**  
**LeetCode**: [183. Customers Who Never Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/)  
**Problem**: Find customers who never placed an order.  
**Why Famous**: Tests understanding of **`LEFT JOIN` vs `NOT IN` vs `NOT EXISTS`**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- `LEFT JOIN` + `WHERE right.id IS NULL`  
- Danger of `NOT IN` with `NULL`  

‚úÖ **Best Answer**:
```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
```

### 5. **Department Highest Salary**  
**LeetCode**: [184. Department Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-highest-salary/)  
**Problem**: Find employees with the highest salary in each department.  
**Why Famous**: One of the **most asked** ‚Äî tests **window functions** and joins.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- `MAX() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId)`  
- Or `RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()`  
- Join with `Department` table  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT name, salary, departmentId,
           MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId) AS max_sal
    FROM Employee
) e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE e.salary = e.max_sal;
```

---

### 6. **Consecutive Numbers**  
**LeetCode**: [180. Consecutive Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/)  
**Problem**: Find numbers that appear at least 3 times consecutively.  
**Why Famous**: Tests **pattern matching across rows**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Self-join: `id`, `id+1`, `id+2`  
- Or `LAG()` / `LEAD()`  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id + 1 = l2.id
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id + 2 = l3.id
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
```

---

### 7. **Nth Highest Salary**  
**LeetCode**: [177. Nth Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/)  
**Problem**: Write a function to find the Nth highest distinct salary.  
**Why Famous**: Generalization of "Second Highest" ‚Äî tests **functions, variables, OFFSET**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- `LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1`  
- Variable handling in MySQL  
- Use of `RETURN (SELECT ...)` to auto-return `NULL`  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET N - 1
  );
END;
```

### 8. **Rising Temperature**  
**LeetCode**: [197. Rising Temperature](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)  
**Problem**: Find days where temperature was higher than the previous day.  
**Why Famous**: Classic **row-to-row comparison**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Self-join with `DATEDIFF(t1.date, t2.date) = 1`  
- Or `LAG()`  

‚úÖ **Sample Answer**:
```sql
SELECT t1.id
FROM Weather t1
JOIN Weather t2 ON DATEDIFF(t1.recordDate, t2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE t1.temperature > t2.temperature;
```

---

### 9. **Trips and Users (Hard but Famous)**  
**LeetCode**: [262. Trips and Users](https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/)  
**Problem**: Report cancellation rate per day, excluding banned users.  
**Why Famous**: Asked at **Uber, Lyft, DoorDash** ‚Äî tests **joins, filtering, ROUND(), conditional aggregation**.  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Multiple `JOIN`s  
- `BETWEEN` for date range  
- `ROUND(AVG(condition), 2)`  

‚úÖ **Pro Tip**: Use `CASE WHEN status LIKE 'cancelled%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`

---

### 10. **Sales Analysis or Product Revenue Reports**  
**LeetCode**: [1069. Product Sales Analysis II](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-ii/)  
**Problem**: Sum quantity per product, or average price, etc.  
**Why Famous**: Real-world **business analytics** question.  
**Key Concepts**:

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_qty
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

## üí° Pro Tips for Acing SQL Interviews

1. **Explain your approach first** ‚Äî interviewers care about logic, not just code.
2. **Handle edge cases**: `NULL`s, duplicates, empty tables.
3. **Use aliases** and format code cleanly.
4. **Know the difference**:
   - `WHERE` vs `HAVING`
   - `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN`
   - `RANK()` vs `DENSE_RANK()`
5. **Practice window functions** ‚Äî they‚Äôre the #1 differentiator.
