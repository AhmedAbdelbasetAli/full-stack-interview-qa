# 🔐 Web Security Deep Dive (Part 2)  
**CORS, HTTPS, HSTS, Input Validation & Output Encoding**

This document provides a **comprehensive, in-depth explanation** of essential **web security concepts** — critical for **secure application design**, **backend development**, and **security-conscious engineering**.

Each section includes:
- ✅ Clear definition
- ✅ In-depth explanation
- ✅ Real-world examples
- ✅ Security risks
- ✅ Interview-ready answers

## 1. What is CORS? Can it be a security risk if misconfigured?

> **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a **browser security mechanism** that **controls how web pages can make requests to a different domain**.

It prevents malicious sites from reading sensitive data from another origin.

---

### 🔹 1.1 How CORS Works

When a frontend (e.g., `https://app.com`) calls an API (e.g., `https://api.bank.com`):

1. Browser sends **preflight request** (`OPTIONS`) for non-simple requests
2. Server responds with headers like:
   ```http
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.com
   Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
   Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
   ```
3. If allowed → actual request proceeds

---

### 🔹 1.2 Common CORS Headers

| Header | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Which domains can access the API |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` | Which HTTP methods are allowed |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` | Which headers can be sent |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Whether cookies are allowed |
| `Access-Control-Max-Age` | Cache preflight response |

---

### 🔹 1.3 Security Risks of Misconfiguration

| Misconfiguration | Risk |
|------------------|------|
| ❌ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Allow-Credentials: true` | **Critical**: Allows any site to read authenticated data |
| ❌ `Allow-Origin: null` or `file://` | Attackers can bypass via local files |
| ❌ Overly permissive methods/headers | Enables unwanted actions (e.g., `DELETE`) |

---

### 🔹 1.4 Example: Dangerous Setup

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

✅ **This is a vulnerability** — any website can make authenticated requests and read responses.

---

### ✅ Secure Configuration

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-app.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

✅ Only allow **specific, trusted origins** — never `*` when credentials are involved.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"CORS controls cross-origin API access. If misconfigured — like allowing `*` with credentials — it becomes a security risk. An attacker can steal user data by tricking the browser into making authenticated requests. I always specify exact origins, avoid wildcards with credentials, and validate CORS settings in production."_

## 2. What is HTTP vs HTTPS? How does TLS/SSL work?

| Feature | HTTP | HTTPS |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Security** | ❌ Unencrypted | ✅ Encrypted (TLS/SSL) |
| **Port** | 80 | 443 |
| **Data** | Plain text | Encrypted |
| **SEO & Trust** | Lower | Higher (🔒 padlock) |
| **Performance** | Slightly faster | Slight overhead (negligible with HTTP/2) |

---

### 🔹 2.1 How TLS/SSL Works (Simplified)

TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts data between client and server.

#### 🟦 Handshake Process

1. **Client Hello**: Client → Server: "Let’s connect"
2. **Server Hello**: Server → Client: "Here’s my certificate"
3. **Certificate Validation**: Client checks if cert is valid and trusted
4. **Key Exchange**: Client and server agree on a **session key** (using RSA or ECDHE)
5. **Encrypted Communication**: All data encrypted with session key

✅ Ensures:
- **Confidentiality** (no eavesdropping)
- **Integrity** (no tampering)
- **Authentication** (server is who it claims to be)

---

### 🔹 2.2 What is a TLS Certificate?

- Issued by a **Certificate Authority (CA)** (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert)
- Contains:
  - Domain name
  - Public key
  - Expiry date
  - Issuer
- Browser checks:
  - Is it trusted?
  - Does it match the domain?
  - Is it expired?

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"HTTP sends data in plain text — anyone can read it. HTTPS encrypts traffic using TLS/SSL. During the handshake, the server presents a certificate, the client validates it, and they establish an encrypted session. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering. I always use HTTPS in production — it’s a basic requirement for security and trust."_  

---

## 3. What is HSTS and why is it important?

> **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** is a security header that **forces the browser to use HTTPS only** — even if the user types `http://`.

It prevents **SSL stripping attacks**.

---

### 🔹 3.1 How HSTS Works

Server sends:
```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

✅ Browser remembers:
- For `max-age` seconds (1 year)
- All requests to this domain go to HTTPS
- Even if user types `http://`, browser auto-upgrades

---

### 🔹 3.2 HSTS Directives

| Directive | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| `max-age=31536000` | Remember for 1 year |
| `includeSubDomains` | Apply to all subdomains (e.g., `api.example.com`) |
| `preload` | Submit to browser preload list (hardcoded in Chrome/Firefox) |

---

### 🔹 3.3 Why HSTS is Critical

#### 🟦 Attack: SSL Stripping
1. User types `http://bank.com`
2. Attacker intercepts → serves fake site over HTTP
3. User logs in → credentials stolen

✅ With HSTS:
- Browser **never sends HTTP request**
- Auto-upgrades to HTTPS
- Prevents downgrade attacks

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"HSTS forces browsers to use HTTPS only, preventing SSL stripping attacks. Once set, even if a user types 'http', the browser upgrades to 'https'. I set `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` in production. It’s a critical header for any site handling sensitive data."_  

---

## 4. What is input validation and why is it critical for security?

> **Input validation** ensures that **user-supplied data meets expected rules** before processing.

It’s the **first line of defense** against attacks.

---

### 🔹 4.1 Types of Input Validation

| Type | Example |
|------|--------|
| **Whitelist Validation** | Allow only known good patterns (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`) |
| **Length Check** | Limit input size (e.g., max 100 chars) |
| **Type Check** | Ensure number, email, date format |
| **Sanitization** | Remove/escape dangerous characters |

---

### 🔹 4.2 Security Risks Without Validation

| Attack | How Input Validation Prevents It |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Reject `'`, `--`, `;` or use parameterized queries |
| **XSS** | Strip/encode `<`, `>`, `&`, `"` |
| **Command Injection** | Block `;`, `&`, `|`, `$()` |
| **Path Traversal** | Block `../`, `..\` |
| **Buffer Overflow** | Enforce max length |

---

### 🔹 4.3 Example: Secure User Registration

```java
public class UserRequest {
    @NotBlank
    @Size(min = 2, max = 50)
    private String name;

    @Email
    private String email;

    @Pattern(regexp = "^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\\d)[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*#?&]{8,}$")
    private String password;
}
```

✅ Validate on **both client and server** — client for UX, server for security.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Input validation ensures user data is safe and well-formed before processing. It prevents SQLi, XSS, and command injection. I validate on the server using whitelists, length limits, and regex. I never trust client-side validation alone. It’s critical because untrusted input is the root of most web vulnerabilities."_  

---

## 5. What is output encoding? When should it be used?

> **Output encoding** converts special characters into a **safe format** so they are **not interpreted as code**.

It’s essential for **preventing XSS**.

---

### 🔹 5.1 How Output Encoding Works

| Character | Encoded Form |
|----------|--------------|
| `<` | `&lt;` |
| `>` | `&gt;` |
| `&` | `&amp;` |
| `"` | `&quot;` |
| `'` | `&#x27;` |

---

### 🔹 5.2 Context Matters

| Context | Encoding Type |
|--------|---------------|
| **HTML Body** | HTML entity encoding (`<` → `&lt;`) |
| **HTML Attribute** | Attribute encoding |
| **JavaScript** | JavaScript encoding (`\x3c`) |
| **URL** | URL encoding (`%3C`) |

✅ Always encode for the **correct context**.

---

### 🔹 5.3 Example: Safe Output

❌ Bad:
```java
out.println("<div>" + userInput + "</div>");
```

✅ Good:
```java
out.println("<div>" + HTMLEncode(userInput) + "</div>");
```

Or use frameworks that auto-encode:
- **React**: Auto-escapes `{userInput}`
- **Thymeleaf**: `[[${userInput}]]` auto-escapes
- **JSP**: `<c:out value="${userInput}" />`

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Output encoding converts special characters like '<' into safe entities like '&lt;' so they're not interpreted as HTML or JS. It prevents XSS when displaying untrusted data. I use context-specific encoding — HTML, JS, or URL — and rely on frameworks like React or Thymeleaf that auto-escape by default. It’s a must for any dynamic content."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine defenses**:
> _"I use input validation to sanitize data, output encoding to prevent XSS, HTTPS with HSTS for encryption, and strict CORS to control API access."_  

That shows **defense-in-depth thinking** — exactly what senior roles want.
