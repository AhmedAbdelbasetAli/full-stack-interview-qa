## 1. What is System Design? What are the key goals when designing a scalable system?

> **System Design** is the process of **defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data** for a system to meet specific requirements.

It’s about **how to build a system** that is:
- ✅ Scalable
- ✅ Reliable
- ✅ Maintainable
- ✅ Cost-effective

---

### 🔹 1.1 Key Goals of a Scalable System

| Goal | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| ✅ **Scalability** | Handle growing traffic (users, data, requests) |
| ✅ **Reliability** | System works correctly even during failures |
| ✅ **Availability** | System is up and accessible (e.g., 99.9% uptime) |
| ✅ **Latency** | Fast response times (low delay) |
| ✅ **Throughput** | High number of requests processed per second |
| ✅ **Consistency** | Data is accurate and synchronized |
| ✅ **Security** | Protected from attacks and breaches |
| ✅ **Maintainability** | Easy to update, debug, and extend |

---

### 🔹 1.2 Example: Designing a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)

**Requirements**:
- Accept a long URL → return a short one
- Redirect short URL → original
- High traffic (millions of requests/day)
- Low latency (<100ms)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use **hashing** (e.g., Base62) to generate short codes
- Store mappings in **database** (SQL or NoSQL)
- Add **caching** (Redis) for hot URLs
- Use **load balancer** + **multiple servers**
- Add **CDN** for global access

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"System design is about architecting a system to meet functional and non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability, and low latency. Key goals include handling high traffic, minimizing downtime, and ensuring fast performance. I start by clarifying requirements, estimating scale, and then designing components like load balancers, caches, databases, and services. For example, in a URL shortener, I’d use hashing, caching, and replication to ensure speed and availability."_

## 2. What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?

| Feature | Vertical Scaling (Scale Up) | Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out) |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Add more power (CPU, RAM) to a single machine | Add more machines to the system |
| **Cost** | Expensive (high-end hardware) | Cheaper (commodity servers) |
| **Limits** | Hardware limits (max RAM/CPU) | Theoretically unlimited |
| **Single Point of Failure** | ✅ Yes (one machine) | ❌ No (redundant nodes) |
| **Maintenance** | Harder (downtime for upgrades) | Easier (take nodes out one by one) |
| **Use Case** | Small apps, legacy systems | Web apps, microservices, cloud |

---

### 🔹 2.1 Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

```
[User] → [Single Powerful Server (16 CPU, 64GB RAM)]
```

✅ Pros:
- Simple architecture
- No data partitioning

❌ Cons:
- Hardware limits
- Single point of failure
- Downtime for upgrades

---

### 🔹 2.2 Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

```
[User] → [Load Balancer] → [Server 1]  
                     → [Server 2]  
                     → [Server 3]
```

✅ Pros:
- No single point of failure
- Can scale infinitely
- Cloud-friendly (AWS, GCP)

❌ Cons:
- Complex (load balancing, session management)
- Data consistency challenges

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Vertical scaling means adding more power to a single server — simple but limited by hardware. Horizontal scaling means adding more servers — more complex but highly scalable and fault-tolerant. I prefer horizontal scaling for web applications because it supports high availability and works well with cloud platforms. Vertical scaling is fine for small apps, but doesn’t scale to millions of users."_

## 3. What is load balancing? What are common algorithms?

> **Load Balancing** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to **prevent overload** and **improve responsiveness**.

It’s a **critical component** of scalable systems.

---

### 🔹 3.1 How Load Balancing Works

```
[User] → [Load Balancer] → [Server 1]
                        → [Server 2]
                        → [Server 3]
```

✅ Benefits:
- Improves **availability**
- Increases **throughput**
- Enables **zero-downtime deployments**
- Handles **server failures**

---

### 🔹 3.2 Common Load Balancing Algorithms

| Algorithm | How It Works | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Round-Robin** | Distribute requests in order: 1,2,3,1,2,3... | Simple, even distribution |
| **Weighted Round-Robin** | Assign weights (e.g., Server 1: 3, Server 2: 1) | Servers with different capacities |
| **Least Connections** | Send to server with fewest active connections | Long-lived connections (e.g., WebSockets) |
| **IP Hash** | Hash client IP → always go to same server | Session persistence (sticky sessions) |
| **Least Response Time** | Send to server with lowest latency | Performance-critical apps |

---

### 🔹 3.3 Example: Round-Robin vs Least Connections

```text
Servers: [S1, S2, S3]

Round-Robin:
Req1 → S1
Req2 → S2
Req3 → S3
Req4 → S1

Least Connections:
If S1 has 10 connections, S2 has 2 → Req goes to S2
```

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Load balancing distributes traffic across servers to improve performance and availability. Common algorithms include Round-Robin (simple rotation), Least Connections (for long-lived sessions), and IP Hash (for sticky sessions). I use Least Connections in real-time apps and Round-Robin for stateless APIs. Load balancers can be hardware (F5) or software (NGINX, AWS ELB)."_

## 4. What is a reverse proxy? How does it differ from a forward proxy?

| Feature | Reverse Proxy | Forward Proxy |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Location** | In front of **servers** | In front of **clients** |
| **Purpose** | Protect & scale servers | Control & monitor client traffic |
| **Who Uses It** | Server admin | Client/user |
| **Example** | NGINX, Cloudflare | Corporate proxy, VPN |
| **Transparency** | Clients don’t know | Servers don’t know |

---

### 🔹 4.1 Reverse Proxy – For Servers

```
[User] → [Reverse Proxy] → [Web Server]
```

✅ Functions:
- **Load balancing**
- **SSL termination**
- **Caching static content**
- **DDoS protection**
- **Hide internal architecture**

> 🔐 Example: NGINX, AWS ALB, Cloudflare

---

### 🔹 4.2 Forward Proxy – For Clients

```
[User] → [Forward Proxy] → [Internet]
```

✅ Functions:
- **Content filtering** (block sites)
- **Anonymity** (hide client IP)
- **Caching** (save bandwidth)
- **Access control** (corporate policy)

> 🔐 Example: Corporate proxy, Squid

---

### 🔹 4.3 Key Difference

> - **Reverse Proxy**: "I speak for the server"  
> - **Forward Proxy**: "I speak for the client"

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"A reverse proxy sits in front of servers and handles requests on their behalf — used for load balancing, SSL, and security. A forward proxy sits in front of clients and controls their access to the internet — used for filtering and anonymity. In web apps, I use reverse proxies like NGINX to protect and scale backend services, while forward proxies are more common in enterprise networks."_  

---

## 5. What is caching? Where can you implement it?

> **Caching** stores frequently accessed data in **fast storage** to **reduce latency** and **lighten backend load**.

It’s the **#1 performance optimization** in system design.

---

### 🔹 5.1 Where to Cache

| Layer | Technology | Use Case |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Client-Side** | Browser cache, localStorage | Static assets (JS, CSS, images) |
| **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** | Cloudflare, Akamai | Static content, global distribution |
| **Reverse Proxy** | NGINX, Varnish | HTML pages, API responses |
| **Application Server** | In-memory (HashMap, Guava) | Hot data (e.g., config) |
| **Distributed Cache** | Redis, Memcached | Shared cache across servers |
| **Database Layer** | Query cache, index | Speed up queries |

---

### 🔹 5.2 Example: Caching a User Profile

```text
User → CDN → Reverse Proxy → App Server → Redis → Database
```

1. First request → DB → store in Redis
2. Next request → Redis returns in 1ms
3. CDN caches HTML for 5 mins

✅ Reduces DB load by 90%

---

### 🔹 5.3 Cache Invalidation Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **TTL (Time-to-Live)** | Auto-expire after X seconds |
| **Write-through** | Update cache when DB updates |
| **Write-behind** | Update DB asynchronously |
| **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)** | Check cache → if miss, load from DB → store in cache |

✅ Most common: **Cache-Aside** with TTL

---

### 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Caching stores frequently used data in fast storage to reduce latency and database load. I implement it at multiple layers: CDN for static assets, Redis for session and user data, and browser cache for client-side. I use TTL and cache-aside pattern to keep data fresh. Caching is essential for high-traffic systems — it can reduce response time from 100ms to 1ms."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In interviews, **draw the system diagram**:
> ```
> User → CDN → Load Balancer → App Servers → Redis → Database
> ```

> This shows you think in layers and understand real-world architecture.
