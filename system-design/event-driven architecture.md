## 🔹 What is Event-Driven Architecture?

> **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a design pattern where **components communicate via events** — **asynchronous messages** that represent **something that happened**.

Instead of **request-response**, components **publish events** and **react to them**.

---

### ✅ Core Idea: "When X happens, do Y"

```text
[User signs up] → [Event: UserSignedUp] → [Send welcome email]
                                         → [Add to marketing list]
                                         → [Update analytics]
```

✅ One event → multiple reactions  
✅ Producers and consumers are **decoupled**

---

## 🔹 Why Use Event-Driven Architecture?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Loose Coupling** | Services don’t call each other directly |
| ✅ **Scalability** | Each consumer scales independently |
| ✅ **Resilience** | If one service fails, others continue |
| ✅ **Flexibility** | Easy to add new consumers (e.g., fraud detection) |
| ✅ **Real-Time Processing** | React instantly to events |
| ✅ **Auditability** | Event log = system history |
| ✅ **Extensibility** | Add features without modifying core logic |

---

### 🔹 Example: E-Commerce System

```text
[Order Placed] → Event: OrderCreated
                     ↓
       [Inventory Service] → Reserve stock
                     ↓
      [Payment Service] → Charge customer
                     ↓
     [Shipping Service] → Schedule delivery
                     ↓
    [Analytics Service] → Update dashboard
                     ↓
     [Email Service] → Send confirmation
```

✅ No single point of failure  
✅ New services can listen without changing existing code

---

## 🔹 Key Components of EDA

| Component | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ **Event Producer** | Publishes events (e.g., Web App) |
| ✅ **Event** | Message that something happened (e.g., `OrderPlaced`) |
| ✅ **Event Broker** | Manages event delivery (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) |
| ✅ **Event Consumer** | Reacts to events (e.g., Email Service) |
| ✅ **Event Store** | Persistent log of events (for replay, audit) |

---

## 🔹 Event Patterns

### 1. **Event Notification**
- Producer says: "Something happened"
- Consumers decide what to do
- ❌ No guarantee of action

✅ Example: `UserSignedUp` → send email, update analytics

---

### 2. **Event-Carried State Transfer**
- Event includes **state/data** (e.g., user ID, email)
- Consumer doesn’t need to fetch from producer

✅ Example: `UserSignedUp(userId=123, email="a@x.com")`

---

### 3. **Event Sourcing**
- **State is derived from event log**
- Instead of "current balance = $100", store events:
  - `AccountCreated`
  - `MoneyDeposited(amount=50)`
  - `MoneyWithdrawn(amount=20)`
- Rebuild state by replaying events

✅ Benefits:
- Full audit trail
- Time-travel debugging
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

---

### 4. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
- **Separate write (command) and read (query) models**
- Commands → update state (via events)
- Queries → read from optimized read model (e.g., Elasticsearch)

```text
[Web App] → Command: CreateOrder → [Event: OrderCreated] → [Update Read DB]
                                                      ↓
                                              [Query: GetOrders] → Fast read
```

✅ High-performance reads, scalable writes

---

## 🔹 Event Brokers: Kafka vs RabbitMQ

| Feature | **Apache Kafka** | **RabbitMQ** |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Model** | Log Streaming | Message Queue |
| **Persistence** | Always (disk-based) | Optional |
| **Throughput** | Very high (~1M+ msgs/sec) | High (~10K–100K) |
| **Latency** | Low | Very low |
| **Message Replay** | ✅ Yes (retain logs) | ❌ No |
| **Use Case** | Event sourcing, real-time pipelines | Task queues, RPC |
| **Ordering** | Per partition | Per queue |
| **Complex Routing** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (exchanges) |

---

### ✅ When to Use Which?

| Need | Choice |
|------|--------|
| ✅ "Replay events for debugging" | Kafka |
| ✅ "Exactly-once delivery" | Kafka |
| ✅ "Fan-out to 10 services" | RabbitMQ (with exchanges) or Kafka |
| ✅ "Simple task queue" | RabbitMQ or SQS |
| ✅ "Real-time analytics pipeline" | Kafka |
| ✅ "Request-response (RPC)" | RabbitMQ |

---

## 🔹 Event Design Best Practices

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| ✅ **Use Past Tense** | `UserSignedUp`, not `SignUpUser` |
| ✅ **Include Event ID, Timestamp** | For deduplication and ordering |
| ✅ **Make Events Immutable** | Never change an event |
| ✅ **Include Enough Data** | Avoid consumers calling back |
| ✅ **Version Events** | `UserSignedUpV1`, `UserSignedUpV2` |
| ✅ **Use Schema Registry** | For type safety (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry) |
| ✅ **Avoid Sensitive Data** | Don’t put passwords in events |

---

### ✅ Example Event (JSON)
```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-abc123",
  "eventType": "UserSignedUp",
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-05T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user-123",
    "email": "alice@x.com",
    "name": "Alice"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔹 Handling Failures & Reliability

| Challenge | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ❌ **Consumer Failure** | Retry with backoff, dead-letter queue (DLQ) |
| ❌ **Duplicate Events** | Idempotent consumers (use event ID) |
| ❌ **Event Order** | Use partitioning (e.g., by `userId`) |
| ❌ **Event Loss** | Use persistent brokers (Kafka), acks |
| ❌ **Backpressure** | Consumer pulls at its pace |

---

### ✅ Idempotency Example
```java
public void onUserSignedUp(UserSignedUp event) {
    if (processedEvents.contains(event.eventId)) {
        return; // Already processed
    }
    // Process event
    sendWelcomeEmail(event.email);
    processedEvents.add(event.eventId);
}
```

> ✅ Use Redis or database to track processed event IDs.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Use Cases

| Industry | Use Case |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ **E-Commerce** | Order processing, inventory updates |
| ✅ **Finance** | Fraud detection, transaction logging |
| ✅ **Social Media** | Feed updates, notifications |
| ✅ **IoT** | Sensor data processing, alerts |
| ✅ **Gaming** | Leaderboards, real-time events |
| ✅ **Logistics** | Tracking, ETA updates |

---

## 🔹 Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ✅ Loose coupling | ❌ Complexity (event flow hard to trace) |
| ✅ Scalability | ❌ Debugging is harder (no call stack) |
| ✅ Resilience | ❌ Eventual consistency |
| ✅ Real-time | ❌ Overuse can lead to chaos |
| ✅ Extensibility | ❌ Requires good monitoring |

## 📌 Interview Answer

> _"Event-Driven Architecture uses events to decouple services. When something happens (e.g., order placed), it publishes an event. Other services react asynchronously. I use it for scalability and resilience. I choose Kafka for event sourcing and replay, RabbitMQ for task queues. I ensure idempotency, use versioned events, and handle failures with retries and DLQs. It’s powerful but requires good observability."_  

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> 🎯 In system design interviews:
> _"I’d use EDA for an e-commerce app: when an order is placed, publish OrderCreated. Inventory, Payment, and Email services react independently. I’d use Kafka for durability and replay."_  

That shows **deep architectural thinking**.
