## üîß Fundamentals & Concepts

1. What is system design? What are the key goals when designing a scalable system?

2. What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?

3. What is load balancing? What are common algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections)?

4. What is a reverse proxy? How does it differ from a forward proxy?

5. What is caching? Where can you implement it (client, CDN, server, database)?

6. What is a CDN? How does it improve performance?

7. What is database replication? What are master-slave and master-master setups?

8. What is database sharding? How do you choose a shard key?

9. What is the CAP theorem? Explain consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

10. What is eventual consistency? When is it acceptable?

11. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL in system design?

12. What is message queuing? When would you use it?

13. What are common message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)?

14. What is rate limiting? Why is it important?

15. What are common rate-limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, sliding window)?

## üõ† Architecture & Patterns

31. What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?

32. What are the pros and cons of microservices?

## üìä Performance & Scalability

41. How would you handle 1 million concurrent users?

42. How do you scale a database under high read/write load?

43. How do you monitor and debug a distributed system?

44. What is observability? What are its pillars (logging, metrics, tracing)?

45. How do you design for high availability?

46. What is fault tolerance? How do you achieve it?

47. How do you handle data consistency across services?

48. What is a distributed cache? How does Redis help?

49. How do you perform a rolling deployment?

50. What is blue-green deployment and canary release?

## üìå Tip:
Use the **4S Framework** to structure your answers:  
**S**cale (traffic, storage), **S**torage (database, caching), **S**ervices (APIs, components), **S**ync (messaging, events).  
Always clarify requirements first ‚Äî ask questions!
